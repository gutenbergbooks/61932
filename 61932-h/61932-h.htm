<h2><i>TO FLORENCE BELL</i></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Chinsegut, Hernando County, Florida</span><br />
Jan. 20, 1906</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My Dear F. B.</span>:</p>

<p>I believe it to be commonly the practice of authors to write
the dedication last. But I, being summoned by the laconic
imperative of the Atlantic cable to exchange London for
Florida, and being thereby arrested midway in what I have
always thought of as your book, must needs recover some of
the old impulse that you gave me to begin it, before I can
go on.</p>

<p>I invoke you as I would a breath of your invigorating
Yorkshire, for I am captive in a land of idleness—myself
idlest of all the easy, time-squandering folk that are making
believe to finish my house here upon the sunburnt hilltop.</p>

<p>This lodge in the wilderness, uplifted like an island above
encompassing seas of green; this wind-swept, sun-steeped place,
ought, perhaps (in spite of latitude and longitude), to give
me back without your aid the picture and the feeling of the
North. For the first word I set at the top of my page, though
Indian, would not have been understanded of my ancient
neighbors here. Not the Seminoles, the Alaskans gave us
our name. I and another for whom it means home, pronounced
it first to the rhythm of breakers beating on that wild
Bering coast—in the midst of the pandemonium of the “farthest
North” gold boom, we dreamed and planned the picture
I look out upon this morning. It might not seem beautiful
to you, yet, in spite of your wise warning, there have gone
into my effort to make the dream come true the most precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
things I had. Into this Chinsegut, as you know, went, amongst
the rest, a great faith.</p>

<p>So that, however reminiscent of people or conditions long
since passed away, however much of the spirit of the past is
garnered here as living influence, or as debris and as ashes,
these were for me infinitesimal affairs by comparison with the
hope for the Future that made me turn deaf ears to your
admonishing. For this was to be a place where my fellow-dreamer
and I should not only rest, but having rested, work
as never before. Our best and biggest room was to be called
the Workroom.</p>

<p>But some strange spell has hitherto hung over that apartment
and all the house, since even the white remodelers of the
slave-built dwelling have found it easier to play than work
here.</p>

<p>As if foreseeing that the added wing, new stable, and the
rest, would take more months a-building than they would need
weeks in other climes, our “workmen,” uneasy perhaps under
the misnomer, organized themselves into a Musical Society.
They would lay a brick or rap in a nail, and then, casting
aside trowel or hammer, would catch up fiddle and bow, horn,
or clarinet, trying (since walls had been known to fall at
trumpet blast) whether these could be induced to rise to
strains of “Dixie.” One of the band to whom I owe my not
very sound roof, was at least a person of imagination, as I
will make your ladyship admit, if the distractions here will
give me leave to try. These are not solely the growling of
saws, the scraping of planes and of fiddles. I find myself
forever running to and fro like a child in some enchanted
playground, wooed by fifty things at once—but not one of
them has aught to do with books or with any aspect of the art
of letters.</p>

<p>My distractions have to do with such toys as the joy of
re-discovering old friends in all three kingdoms, from the forgotten
beauty of palms standing sentinel-like in sand as white
as meal, to the blue heron that goes sailing by to the lake at
our feet. Or I am called early to see the delicate print of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
deer’s foot that passed our very gate; or I must watch the
sun caught at setting in the great ilex, and see the light spilling
into the Spanish moss, soaking into the long draperies,
till they seem to hold refulgence in solution. Or I must go and
plan the hedge of roses round an old burying-ground on the
place, or listen half a morning to a mocking-bird, or steal
down in the dusk to my beloved copse and play eavesdropper
to the sullen owl who pretends he doesn’t haunt the magnolia
above the spring. Or I must leave my coveted place of shade
on the north veranda and come to watch our friend, Mr. Tarrypin,
creeping heavily by in the hot sun on his way (I grieve
to tell you) to the soup tureen. (“Lawd, yes. Tarrypin?
He jes de same es chick’n, Miss ’Lizbess—once he in de pot!”)</p>

<p>Even my interviews with the cook, elsewhere so summarily
despatched, are here a thief of time. For our Peter, who
learned his craft of the Cubans during the late war, is the
most beguiling of conversationalists. In beautiful sky-blue,
brass-buttoned clothes showing under a spotless apron, he
stands, interlarding his promise to “do it Spanish style,” with
legends learned of his mother who was born in the negro
quarters here in those more sumptuous days when our hill
was crowned with the finest orange grove in all Hernando.
Peter will tell you, chuckling, that our great twelve by twelve-inch
cypress beams that turn the edge of the white carpenters’
tools, were hand-hewn by his grandfather, and by that gallant
woodman “tied and pinned” to frame the house before the
“orange” days—when all cleared land was cotton field.</p>

<p>But more than by any other creature the spirit of idleness
has been fostered by my four-footed friend, the particular joy
of my life here, Dixie. For I must tell you that one’s love of
woods is only whetted by looking out, as I am told we do, upon
two hundred and fifty thousand acres of virgin forest—the
old Seminole hunting-grounds—which swallow up the white
man’s puny clearings so effectually that even a Zeiss glass can
scarcely pick them out. Dixie and I may travel for hours,
through tangles of jessamine-laced live-oak and palmetto,
down to dim lakes where the cypresses stand in water to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
“knees” (with all the moss curtains close-drawn against the
sun), and never see a soul. Then, when even in the open ways
of the pine woods we find the warm day quenched in mist,
I let the rein fall slack and trust to that skill of Dixie’s, never
baffled yet, to take me home the shortest way, in spite of night
or storm or the fierce dazzle of tropic lightning.</p>

<p>If we are late, we know “Uncle” Fielding will be looking
out for us. Even if I fail to distinguish his kind, dark face,
I see the whites of his eyes shining, I hear his rich voice
lowered to reproach that I should be abroad so late in the vast
Annuttalagga woods that go to the verge of the world.</p>

<p>But Uncle Fielding has his share in my idleness, for he
knows the stories I like best of all. When I’ve gone to sit
within the radiance of the great open fireplace (less for
warmth than for sake of cedar scent and love of the flaring,
singing resin in the pine), Uncle Fielding will come staggering
in under the weight of a single log, and having thrown it
down, will tarry awhile. To my polite hope that he feels at
home in his new cottage, he replies with gentle assurance: “I’ll
haf to be mighty ole and mighty painful befoh I leave this
hilltop.” With humility I learn to see myself as the transient
one, the visitor, and Uncle Fielding as the one who rightly is
“at home.” Even for neighborly credit and fair regard I look
to him. For when one of the younger generation, or some mere
new-comer ventures: “They say, in the old days, you knew
her brother,” “<em>Knew</em> him?” says Uncle Fielding loftily, “<em>I
raised him</em>—” and so re-establishes our respectability in a
land that for so many years has known us only as little-remembered
names.</p>

<p>Can you not see that with the vivid intervention of all this
new-old life—the story you bade me write has in a brief space
gone to a distance so illimitable that beside such a standard
of remoteness, Florida is neighbor to the Pole? I tell you
plainly that if this book of yours is ever to be finished, you
must send me something of that influence that has so often
spurred me on before. Once even here, a touch of it, like
your hand on my shoulder, reached me one evening, in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
of all the hosts of Hernando. Walking about at sunset to
count how many mangoes were growing near the house—I
was pursued as far as the great ilex at the gates by faint
intermittent strains of some unearthly music. I looked up,
thinking of those “harps” that Hilda heard and to whose
strains she unsealed the Master Builder’s ears. Again that
music! faint but unmistakable; sad and wild, with its vaguely
inciting call. A little shamefaced for my fancy, I said to
one who knew not Hilda: “I could almost swear I heard
harps in the air.” “Yes,” was the answer, “on the roof,” as
though it were the most natural thing on earth that a carpenter,
instead of making us rain-proof, should devise and lash
in place a wind-harp over our heads! I thought how you
would have disapproved that man—and cherished him.</p>

<p>Although the winds that come sweeping over the Mexican
Gulf have cast the great lyre down from my housetop—nevertheless,
now that I’ve invoked you, I seem to hear the
air again—even feel on my shoulder that touch of your hand
with which you sent me forth to try if, in the midst of the
London din, we might not make folk pause an instant, and
say with upturned faces: “Harps in the air!” You and I have
heard them for many a year, my friend. I think I never was
with you long, but I caught some note of that far music. Even
with the thick of the world between us, I listen for you to call
the tune that “sends me on.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">A crisis in the financial world of California
kept the men who were employed in the
Palmas Valley Bank of Valdivia hard at
work for several hours after statutory closing
time.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Mar never came home in these days without
bringing a black leather bag full of papers, to work over
in the dining-room.</p>

<p>He had his big desk in there because Mrs. Mar thought
it out of place in the parlor, though the parlor was the
quietest room in the house and the least used, whereas the
dining-room was the most frequented quarter of the
modest establishment, and the very place where both the
big desk, and the big man who sat before it, were most in
the way.</p>

<p>For here the family not only ate their meals, but here,
in Mrs. Mar’s rocking-chair, the screams of the infant
daughter were drowned in milk or overcome by sleep;
here the two small boys were taught letters and manners;
here, on their mother’s work-table, was reared the ever-renewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
mountain of “mending,” and these the walls that
oftener than any others looked down upon the mistress’s
struggles with the “single-handed help”—a succession
of Irish or Scandinavian girls who came, saw, conquered
some of the china, and departed.</p>

<p>This concentration of family life in the dining-room
was not peculiar to the Mars. Valdivia—all California,
indeed all the towns of all the northern and western
states, were full of houses where the shut-up parlors bore
dumb witness to a social habit that was become mere
tradition.</p>

<p>The forebears of these people, especially those German,
French, or Spanish, had need of a room where they might
receive their friends and talk to them at their ease. But
in their descendants this much chastened need had taken
on the air of an indulgence, and was shrinking out of
sight.</p>

<p>It is true that even the less well-to-do, summoning all
their strength, sometimes gave “parties,” but few houses
encouraged the cheerful custom of having friends “drop
in.” And so, no more useless room in any dwelling than
the parlor. Yet so great was the power of this tradition
of a lost hospitality, that people who had almost nothing
else over and above the grimmest necessities, still had
their parlor. Discomfort and cramping of every kind
was stoically borne that the sacred precincts might be
preserved inviolate. For what? Nobody ever asked.</p>

<p>So then, in the dining-room, sat Nathaniel Mar even on
this fine Sunday afternoon, when, as a rule, the desk was
shut and the owner gone to potter in the garden. But the
exigency was great, and for once even the Seventh Day
had brought no rest. As he sat there, bent over the desk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the light fell with such harshness on the man’s foreshortened
features, under the unkempt mop of prematurely
graying hair, that you would not easily have
believed him to be under forty odd.</p>

<p>He was not yet thirty-five. The deep line that dropped
from the side of each nostril, to lose itself in the heavy,
dark mustache, gave to his face a stricken and weariful
air. And he sat crooked, with one high shoulder more
hunched than the other. You saw the reason of that
when he got up to shut out the sounds of pan-banging,
and fire-irons rattling, that came in through the inch of
open door opposite the one leading into the hall. Before
rising, Mar had felt for his walking-stick, and any one
who noticed how heavily he bore upon it in limping over
the worn carpet, knew why it was that one of his great
shoulders was pushed awry.</p>

<p>He made the same detour in returning to his seat as
had carried him to the kitchen door, carefully cruising
round the pitfall presented by a half-yard or so of extra
dilapidation in the yellow-brown carpet. As you looked
closer at what his avoidance made more noticeable, you
saw that a less faded piece had been tacked over a part
hopelessly worn and mended, and how even this newer
square had despairingly let go of the tacks that held it,
and been kicked up by some foot less considerate or more
courageous than Mr. Mar’s. The superimposed piece sat
now, in a frayed, rag-baggy condition, gaping with
despair, and like some beggar in extremis by the way,
ready to lay hold on the first unwary foot that passed.</p>

<p>The entire room wore that indescribable air of settled
melancholy that no one thing in it, not even the carpet,
seemed quite ugly or uncomfortable enough to account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
for. The furniture was heavy and old. Upon the walls,
besides two or three reconnaissance maps, were some inoffensive
prints. A “Signing of the Declaration of Independence”
hung high between the two windows, and
underneath, in oval, gilt frames, were companion pictures
of Mar’s mother and of his father, who had been
for many years minister to Valdivia’s first Presbyterian
Church.</p>

<p>On the opposite wall a good engraving of Lincoln was
flanked, somewhat incongruously, by a photograph of a
buxom young woman with a group of girls behind her—Mar’s
wife in her school-teaching days, with her class.
Besides these, an old view of the Lake of Geneva, a print
of Cromwell, and on the wall behind Mar’s revolving
chair, an engraved portrait, bearing underneath it the
inscription: John W. Galbraith, President Rock Hill
Mining Co.</p>

<p>Even if these adornments were of a very mild description,
they, at least, covered several feet of the marbled
yellow paper that apparently had been chosen (and
chosen a good while ago) to “go with” the hideous
“grained” woodwork. That it did “go with” that peculiarly
perverse soiling and smearing of inoffensive surfaces,
may not be denied. It went far. It arrived at
such a degree of success that all the little room irradiated
a bilious yellowness “clawed” with muddy brown.</p>

<p>The very atmosphere was not left as nature sent it in
at the window. It halted upon the sill and changed
color, like one who gets wind of ill news. The moment it
penetrated beyond the holland blinds it turned sick and
overflowed the room in dirty saffron.</p>

<p>It may well be wondered why any creature who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
not obliged to should come here. And yet the defeated-looking
man at the window did not lack high companionship.
Sunset and the rain, the call of the winds, clouds
of majesty, and mists of silver, not these alone. Daydreams
penetrated the sullen walls. Here, where the
rudest emigrant would not long abide, fair visions made
themselves at home—“exultations, agonies”—a field here
for the unconquerable mind no more unfit than many another
for the long battle men call life.</p>

<p>On this particular July afternoon, Nathaniel Mar had
no sooner shut out one order of disturbance, than another
penetrated the room from a different direction.</p>

<p>“Sigma!” a loud, clear voice was calling from the
region of the stairs. “Sigma,” and again, “Sigma!
Have you set the table? Sigma-a-a!”</p>

<p>Nathaniel Mar wrote on.</p>

<p>The door opened suddenly and in came a brisk, rather
handsome, dark-eyed woman, with an infant on her arm.
Singularly enough the child seemed to be as little interrupted
in its occupation of sleeping as the father in his
writing. There were certain sounds that both were inured
to. Among others, Mrs. Mar calling “Sigma,” or
“Kate,” or “Jane.” But when she stopped short near
the threshold and asked:</p>

<p>“Where is that girl?” Mar, without raising his eyes
from his paper, made a little motion toward the door he
had just shut.</p>

<p>“I should think,” he said, quietly, “she was probably
breaking up the kitchen stove.”</p>

<p>Before he finished, Mrs. Mar had opened the other
door, and again called “Sigma!”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes.” In rushed a little white-headed Swede,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
fourteen to fifteen years of age, her sleeves tucked up,
her coarse gown tucked up, her fair skin showing vividly
a sooty mark across her forehead, which she had smudged
down her nose and finely shaded off into the red of her
cheek.</p>

<p>When Sigma was calm and collected she walked the
floor as if it were knee-deep in sand. When she was
agitated she did not walk at all. She plunged. Sigma
was agitated now.</p>

<p>“Coom!” she said, lifting a bare elbow toward the
kitchen as another person might point with a finger.
“Coom!” and turning heavily she was about to plunge
back into her special domain.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Mar arrested her. “Why haven’t you set
the table? Look at the time.” She pointed.</p>

<p>Sigma paused and thought. Following the index
finger she recognized the clock, looked inquiringly from
it to the lady, and then suddenly felt she understood, a
thing of almost exciting infrequency. She scuffled good-naturedly
across the room, picked up the heavy timepiece
and was in the act of handing it to Mrs. Mar.</p>

<p>“Let the clock alone! Put it down, I say. What will
she do next? The table. Table!” She beat upon it
briskly with her one free hand. “<em>Supper.</em>”</p>

<p>“Oh, soopra!” says the girl, setting down the clock
and lurching hurriedly toward the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Stop! Don’t you understand you have to set the
table earlier to-day? Before—you—go—out. Your evening.
Understand? Your friend calls for you at six.”
She indicated the hour on the clock face. “Takes you—heaven
knows where. <em>She</em> doesn’t forget if you do.
<em>Your—evening—out.</em>” As Sigma only stood and stared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
dully, Mrs. Mar dropped into the rocking-chair with,
“I foresee this girl will drive me demented.”</p>

<p>Sigma embraced the opportunity to shuffle toward the
door again.</p>

<p>“Where you off to now? You can’t go till you’ve set
the table. Here!” Still with the well-inured infant
sleeping on her arm, Mrs. Mar, remarking in a conversational
tone that she was “certain she should go mad,”
pulled open the sideboard drawer and took out the tablecloth.
“Put this on. <em>Straight</em>, for a change. Then the
mats.”</p>

<p>The mistress’s eye falling suddenly upon that deplorable
place in the carpet, she was forcibly reminded of the
little copper-toed boots that had wrought the havoc.</p>

<p>“What are they at now?” she said, half to herself, as
she crossed the room, and, craning her chin over the sleeping
child at her breast, she guided the toe of her shoe
under the tacked bit, stroking down the darned tatters
underneath, before she straightened and trod flat the
outer layer. Each time thereafter that she crossed the
troubled area her foot, half-impatient, half-caressing, encouraged
the patch to lie still. “What keeps those children
so quiet? Where are they?”</p>

<p>Sigma, hearing the anxious rise in her mistress’s voice,
dropped the corner of the cloth she was twitching and
rushed for the mats.</p>

<p>“No, no, finish. Here. Straight. Like this.” A moment’s
silence, and then again, “Where are those children?”</p>

<p>Sigma hurriedly offered her the cruet.</p>

<p>“Idiot. I am asking you about the children. The—chil—dren.
Where—are—they? Don’t you know? Little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
boys. Trenn, and Harry, and Jack Galbraith—where
gone?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Yack! He—” Sigma, with great action of
hip and elbow, splurged over to the window, and motioned
away across an empty lot.</p>

<p>“What, <em>again</em>? Here,” Mrs. Mar wheeled upon her
husband, “you must hold the baby a moment. If I lay
her down she’ll wake up and scream.”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Mar hastened out through the kitchen you
could hear that she paused an instant to exclaim aghast
at something she found there.</p>

<p>Mr. Mar had accepted the charge with a curious tranquillity,
making the infant comfortable in the hollow of
his left arm. Then he went on with his writing.</p>

<p>Sigma returned to the intricate task of setting the
table. She did it all with an excited gravity, as if she
were engaged in some spirited game, putting down plates,
knives, and forks with an air of one playing trumps, and
yet not quite sure if it was the right moment for them.
When she had placed the straw mats with mathematical
precision, she drew off proudly, to get the full splendor
of effect. When it came to dealing with the sugar bowl,
she glanced at Mar’s bent head, and helped herself to a
lump, became furiously industrious upon the strength of
that solatium, and plunged after spoons and cups. Whenever
she made a clatter she stopped sucking and glanced
nervously toward Mar, as if she expected him to rise and
overwhelm her.</p>

<p>He, with unlifted head, wrote steadily on.</p>

<p>The child slept.</p>

<p>Sigma put a worn horsehair chair at head and foot
of the table, two high chairs on one side for the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
boys, and an ordinary one on the other; as she did this
last her eye fell on the four cups. She paused uncertain,
till she had noiselessly counted five on her stumpy fingers.
Then, “Oh, Yack maa ha’ en!” she reminded herself,
lurched away into the kitchen and reappeared wiping
a cup on a dish towel, one end of which she had
tucked in her apron string. As she was about to deposit
the fifth cup, she glanced at the man bent over the desk,
and put her disengaged hand again in the sugar bowl.
Mar turned suddenly in his creaking chair; Sigma
started, and meaning to drop the sugar, dropped the cup
instead. She stared an instant, open-mouthed, as at some
unaccountable miracle; and then, with a howl, flung up
her bare arms and fled round the table on her way to
the kitchen, caught her great foot in the carpet-trap and
measured her length on the floor.</p>

<p>“Look here, you must go into the kitchen to do that.”
Mar spoke as one not presuming to deny that it might be
a part of her duty to precipitate herself on her stomach
and howl, but questioning only the propriety of the spot
selected. “I can’t have you doing it here,” he said.</p>

<p>Sigma was still “doing it,” so far as howling went,
but she was also scrambling up, with her elbow held over
her head, as if she counted on a thumping. From under
her bare forearm her streaming eyes looked out at Mar.
Whether the man’s quiet face in the midst of the uproar
astonished, calmed her—she gaped, letting the rude lamentation
die in her throat.</p>

<p>“Men—<em>Meesis Marr—rr</em>!” she said under her breath,
picking up the cup.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar’s husband held out his hand for it. “It’s
only the handle,” he said, and set the cup down on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
writing-table, that he might change the position of the
fretting child. For his long-suffering daughter was at
last roused to protest.</p>

<p>The little maid-servant wiped her eyes, and, with the
air of one who is willing to let bygones be bygones, shuffled
a step nearer to the desk.</p>

<p>“Me—Gif Sigma,” she said, and held out her red
arms.</p>

<p>Mar looked up, understood, and handed over the baby.
It was curious to see the practised sureness with which
this female barbarian—who caught her big feet in the
carpet and dropped the china—with what skill she handled
that fragile and intricate mechanism, an infant.
Mar watched her as she stood there, swaying her own
thick body back and forth like a human rocking-chair,
holding the child in sure comfort, patting it softly, and
crooning to it uncouth words in a foreign tongue. Miss
Mar understood perfectly, and responded by laying her
small pink face against the scullion’s untidy gown and
falling back into slumber.</p>

<p>The opening of the front door, and voices in the hall—above
all one voice ordaining that certain persons should
go up-stairs and <em>wait for her</em>!—made Sigma pause, listen,
and then, still holding close the pacified infant, she
beat a stealthy retreat, shutting the kitchen door behind
her with a softness incredible.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar, upon her reappearance, was seen to be ushering
in by the shoulder an anxious little boy of eight or
nine. As with some force she conveyed him across the
room, his foot caught in the same place where Sigma had
met defeat. But Sigma had not been sustained by Mrs.
Mar’s hand. The lady merely unhooked the boy with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
extra shake. Then, with her free hand, she pulled his
chair out from the table, and thrust him into it.</p>

<p>“Now, you’re to sit right there, and then I’ll know
that at least till supper-time you won’t be getting my
children into any more mischief.”</p>

<p>Mar had looked up upon their entrance, seemed about
to speak, and then dropped a discreet head over his work.</p>

<p>“Where’s the baby?” demanded his wife.</p>

<p>“Sigma—”</p>

<p>“This precious protégé of yours,” interrupted the
lady, again straightening the carpet with the toe of her
shoe; “this precious protégé of yours has pulled up a
plank out of the sidewalk, dragged it across the field
down to the duck-pond, and there I found him, using it
as a raft.”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> hadn’t used it—not yet.” A world of lost opportunity
was heavily recalled.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, <em>you</em> weren’t using it.”</p>

<p>But the irony was lost.</p>

<p>“Vere wasn’t woom for all of us, so I let Twenn and
Hawwy go ve first voyage. I’m vewwy kind to little
boys.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed! So kind you preferred to risk other children’s
lives while you looked on.”</p>

<p>“Looked on? Oh, no, ma’am, didn’t you see I was
workin’ like anyfing?” He glanced across at his ally.
“It was a steamship, Mr. Mar. I was ve injine. I’m a
most glowious injine—”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you please,” Mrs. Mar broke in. “He’s been
propelling the plank all round the pond with those two
poor little innocents on it—the greatest wonder they
weren’t drowned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was very wrong,” said Mr. Mar, gravely—then,
under his breath to his wife, “but the water isn’t much
over a foot at the deepest.”</p>

<p>“Quite enough to drown any wretched baby that might
fall in—but, of course, you defend that boy no matter
what he—”</p>

<p>“Not at all—not at all. I don’t approve in the least
of his—”</p>

<p>“And our two little boys mud and dirt from their
heads to their heels, looking like a couple of chimney-sweeps—”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” said the young gentleman from the
horsehair chair, in a conciliatory tone. “Twenn and
Hawwy ain’t black, only just bwown.”</p>

<p>“Brown, indeed! I’ll brown <em>you</em>, sir, if you ever do
such a thing again while you’re staying <em>here</em>! Harry
with his stocking quite torn off one leg! And Trennor’s
only decent breeches—”</p>

<p>“Vere was a nail in vat board,” Jack explained, conversationally,
putting a finger through a jag in his own
trouser knee.</p>

<p>“Small matter to <em>you</em>, if you do ruin your things.”
(Jack began to swing his muddy feet—it was gloriously
true.) “But you’ve got to remember that other children’s
clothes don’t grow on gooseberry bushes.”</p>

<p>“My pants didn’t neever,” returned Jack, sturdily.</p>

<p>“Keep your feet still and your tongue, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes ’m.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar was in the act of turning away, after a further
slight attention to the carpet patch, when her eye
fell upon the handleless cup on the desk.</p>

<p>“Did you do that?” she demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Mar cleared his throat, and Mrs. Mar for once, not
waiting to hear the horrid details, sat down in her rocking-chair,
despair in her face and the broken cup in her
hand.</p>

<p>“I never saw anything like it. The grate in the kitchen
range has just collapsed, too.”</p>

<p>“Really? That’s bad—”</p>

<p>“It’s worse than bad—it’s awful.”</p>

<p>“We must let the stove people know—”</p>

<p>“How are you going to do that on Sunday?”</p>

<p>“Oh—ah—well, it matters less I suppose on Sunday
than if it happened on a week-day.”</p>

<p>“It won’t matter in the least, of course, to have no hot
water to wash the clothes in, Monday morning. Perhaps
<em>you’ll</em> think it matters more when it comes to eating cold
things for I don’t know how long.”</p>

<p>“I think you’ll find I shall be able to put up with—”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s perfectly true, I always find you readier to
put up with disaster than to struggle against it.”</p>

<p>“How would you propose I should struggle against a
broken stove?”</p>

<p>She turned her flushed face from him.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you not to kick the table?” she demanded
of Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh! Yes ’m. I forgot.” He curled up the disgraced
foot underneath him, for a reminder that it was
to keep still.</p>

<p>“The furniture,” Mrs. Mar went on, looking round
the room, “is quite dilapidated enough without <em>your</em>
making it worse.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I must go and attend to those children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and the supper. But don’t let him kick the furniture,
Nathaniel, even if he is the son of your adored
Galbraith. The owner of all that Rock Hill Mining
property didn’t trouble himself much about <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did. He was a very good friend,” and Mar
made a slight movement as of one clearing a space in the
air before setting to work again.</p>

<p>His wife, in her progress to the door, halted mechanically
in the middle of the patch, as though the
momentary weight of her presence there would leave behind
a subjugating effect. But she murmured absently:
“I must have another hunt for—” Then, turning with
sudden animation: “Is it you who’ve taken away my
tack-hammer?” she demanded of Jack.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Well, understand,” she went on, precisely as though he
had admitted his responsibility for the disappearance of
the tool, “understand you’re to sit there till supper, and
this is the last of your playing about that dirty duck-pond.”</p>

<p>“I forgot it was Sunday,” he said, penitent.</p>

<p>“Sunday or any other day—never again.”</p>

<p>Jack gasped with incredulity, and then, slowly, “You
don’t weally mean we’re never to go to ve pond for ever
and ever!”</p>

<p>“Well, just you try it! And you’ll find yourself going
back to school to spend your holidays with the janitor.”</p>

<p>In the pause that followed this awful threat Jack murmured:
“Never go a-sploring any more!” and then sat
as one paralyzed by an awful and unexpected blow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar replaced the handleless cup upon the table,
and took up the corner of the cloth to determine the extent
of a damage wrought in the last washing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Everything we possess seems to be giving out at once—like
the different parts of the One Hoss Shay. It’s
exactly”—she turned her bright, dark eyes toward the
writing-table, and spoke with a sudden access of vigor—“exactly
as if there was a law that allowed you for
months and years to patch and tinker, to bolster up your
rickety furniture, to darn your old carpets, to reseat your
old chairs, to make over the clothes, to solder the saucepans,
and keep things going generally, up to a given moment.
But when that moment comes”—she lifted her
finger Sibyl-like in the air—“every blessed belonging begins
to crack, or fray, or creak with the pangs of approaching
dissolution. Are you listening to what I say,
Nathaniel? There isn’t a thing in this house that
doesn’t need to be renewed.” She spoke with a directness
that seemed pointedly to include her husband among
the dilapidations. He, half-absent, half-speculative,
looked round upon objects familiar to him from childhood.</p>

<p>“Who’d ever think,” pursued his wife, “who’d ever
think that we’d been married less than eight years?
But this is what comes of not furnishing new when you
first set up housekeeping. If you don’t get nice things
when you marry you never get them.”</p>

<p>“Some people,” said Mar, “seem to like old furniture.”</p>

<p>“Let them have it, then!” Her quick gesture presented
the entire contents of the house to the first bidder.
“<em>I</em> say for young people to begin life with the battered
belongings of their fathers and mothers is a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear,” returned her husband, with some
dignity, “it’s a mistake you had no share in. But,” he
added hastily, “we had no choice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” she said bitterly, “we’ve had very little
choice.”</p>

<p>“We did once,” said Nathaniel Mar.</p>

<p>In the pause she looked down at the patch on the carpet.</p>

<p>“And we ignored it,” he finished.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you are going back upon that old foolishness.”
She turned abruptly and set down the broken cup.</p>

<p>“You didn’t think it so foolish when I first told you
about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, didn’t I!”</p>

<p>“No. It made just all the difference then.”</p>

<p>“What difference, I’d like to know, did it ever
make?”</p>

<p>“It made you say ‘Yes’ after you’d said ‘No.’”</p>

<p>“The more fool I,” she said, and left the room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The big man and the little man sat and looked
at the patch on the carpet, till for one of
them the ragged place disappeared.</p>

<p>A big tear splashed on the grimy little
hand.</p>

<p>But out of the mist, a voice: “Can’t you think of any
safer sort of games?”</p>

<p>The balked navigator sniffed audibly, and with the
back of his hand he made a dirty smear across his wet
face. “We don’t any of us seem to care much about
vem, if vey are too safe.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” and with a faint smile Mar resumed his
writing.</p>

<p>Jack Galbraith sat quite still, for him, with the disgraced
foot tucked under him. But Mar, without raising
his eyes, was conscious as a woman might have been,
of the frequent journey of the small hand across the
eyes, and now and then the more efficacious aid of a
sleeve employed to clear the watery vision.</p>

<p>Presently, “After I ’most dwownded ve childwen, I
expect she wouldn’t let me wead my twavel book. What
do you fink, Mr. Mar?”</p>

<p>The gentleman addressed laid down his pen, but still
looking at it, “Well, I don’t know,” he said cautiously.</p>

<p>Whereupon Jack Galbraith gave way openly to tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re not going to forget,” said the man, with no
great show of sympathy, “you’re not going to forget
that however much a boy’s father leaves him, America
hasn’t got any use for an idle man.”</p>

<p>“It’s Mrs. Mar makes me sit here doin’ nuffin’,” the
child indignantly defended himself.</p>

<p>“Oh, for the moment, yes. But when the time comes
to choose what you’re going to do, Jack—if I’m not at
hand to talk it over, think about civil engineering. It
takes a man about, and on more intelligent terms than
my profession—”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Jack threw in upon the ground swell of a
heavy sob. “I shouldn’t like sittin’ countin’ money in
a bank,” and while he caught his breath he looked about
drearily, as if already he saw himself an imprisoned
cashier.</p>

<p>“Sitting in a bank isn’t the profession I chose, either.
I am—I was a surveyor,” said Nathaniel Mar.</p>

<p>“Oh—h?” inquired the child, in his surprise forgetting
to continue the celebration of his private misfortunes.
“Did <em>you</em> use to go all over everywhere wiv a
spy-glass and a chain?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the members of the Scientific Corps are expected
to go ’ all over everywhere.’”</p>

<p>“Clear wound ve world?”</p>

<p>“Well, <em>we</em> didn’t go round—we went the other way,
the way that takes you to the top.”</p>

<p>“Did you get clear to ve vewwy top of ve world?”</p>

<p>“Nobody’s ever been clear to the top.”</p>

<p>“Why hasn’t anybody?”</p>

<p>“Tough job!”</p>

<p>“Was it tough job to go where you went?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“It wasn’t easy. Some of our work lay quite near
enough to the arctic circle.”</p>

<p>“But I expect you liked it a lot better van—” He
paused, looked about, and felt gloom return upon him.
If Mar was thinking so was Jack Galbraith. Again he
dragged his rough sleeve across his hot, little face.
“Ain’t it perferly awful sittin’ still?” he observed.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s pretty awful,” agreed Mr. Mar, glancing
out of the window.</p>

<p>“Was it up vere you found ve parlor bearskin and
Mrs. Mar’s white fox?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was up there.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure if I’m a engineer or a surveyor <em>I’ll</em> be
able to go up vere where you found—”</p>

<p>“Certain to be able to go somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t I go where you did?” he asked, querulously.
As Mr. Mar did not answer at once, “Isn’t vere
any little fing left to be done up vere?”</p>

<p>“Oh, lots! But you see I went there in ’65—going on
ten years ago, when people thought they’d like to have
a telegraph line between Asia and America. So some of
us went to survey the Alaskan part of the route (only it
wasn’t called Alaska then) and decide the best course
for the line that was to meet the one coming across from
Siberia.” Again Nathaniel Mar studied the end of his
pen.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jack, blowing his nose with an air of
faintly reviving faith in life’s possibilities. “Yes, and
vere you met ve bear, and Mrs. Mar’s white—”</p>

<p>“We got some furs and truck, but we didn’t get the
telegraph line.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you see, only a few years ago people laughed at
the idea of an Atlantic cable. But while we were hard
at work up yonder surveying and clearing and setting
up telegraph poles, didn’t some other fellows prove the
possibility of an Atlantic cable by just going and laying
it! So we were recalled.”</p>

<p>“But you had got pwetty far, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we got pretty far.”</p>

<p>“You got to where ve foxes turn white and ve
bears—”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mar, reflectively, and then there was a
pause.</p>

<p>Jack looked at him. “Couldn’t you tell me about
when you got vat bear, or”—in the tone of one grateful
for small favors—“or how you found Mrs. Mar’s
white—”</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to remember anything specially interesting
about the bears or the foxes.” His far-off look
gave the little boy a sudden feeling of being abandoned
by his one friend. He stood it for a moment, and then
suddenly twisted his lithe body round and buried his
face in the crook of the arm that clutched the chair back.
Mar raised his eyes and seemed to come home from some
vast journey.</p>

<p>“Something curious did happen to a man I knew up
there,” he said, in that friendly tone Jack knew so well.
“A fellow who was knocking round the Russian Redoubt
at St. Michaels, with the rest of the Scientific Corps,
waiting for the revenue cutter that was to take us back
to San Francisco. We got pretty tired waiting—”</p>

<p>“Pwickers in your feet?” Jack interrupted, suddenly.
Mar stopped short, for although Jack had uncovered his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
face to listen he was engaged in making the most surprising
grimaces. “I’ve got awful pwickers myself,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Prickers?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Oh, oh, my foot’s full of champagne.” Gingerly,
and with further contortions of countenance, he
stretched the cramped foot out.</p>

<p>“Champagne?” Mar had echoed. “What do you
know about champagne?”</p>

<p>“Once—papa’s birfday. Oh, oh, my foot’s full of it!”</p>

<p>“If it’s gone to sleep you’d better stamp,” recommended
his friend gravely, and Jack applied the remedy
with apparent relief after the first awful shock. He
stood cautiously twisting about to restore circulation
while Mar went on: “Yes, we got pretty tired hanging
round St. Michaels, and one day two of the party took a
boat and went off to an island to get birds’ eggs. While
they were out a storm came up. An awful storm,” he
assured his inattentive listener, but Jack was still gloomily
twirling about, trying his numb foot, and not taking
any stock apparently in a story that didn’t boast a bear
in it, or even a white—</p>

<p>“I never in my life saw anything like it,” Mar went
on. “The gale churned up the sediment of Norton
Sound into a boiling, yellow froth. The sleet gave up
trying to come down, and took to shooting horizontally,
as straight as a charge of musketry, and wherever it hit
bare flesh—” He shook his shaggy head at the memory.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> wouldn’t mind a little fing like vat!” said Jack,
loftily.</p>

<p>“Well,”—Mar accepted the implied criticism with
meekness,—“what they minded most was that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
couldn’t steer a course. It was going to be great luck if
the boat lived at all in such a sea. She was driven north
first. Neither one of the men knew just where it was
they’d got to, but any kind of land was a pretty good
sight. They were almost as glad to get near it as they
were to get away from it.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t vey like it?” Jack didn’t so much as
pause in his twirling to inquire.</p>

<p>“Well, it wasn’t a very pretty place for landing purposes.”</p>

<p>“Ho!” said the young gentleman with careless superiority,
“I don’t mind where <em>I</em> land! One time I landed
wight on top of a earfquake!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Mar, gravely, “that was pretty daring;
but you may depend it wasn’t in as bad a place as the
one I’m talking about. Horrible steep cliffs sheer down
to the shore. Boulders piled helter-skelter. Couldn’t
see much through the dimness of the sleet and the dazzle
of the spray, still, they saw enough to know it wasn’t the
harbor they were hoping for. But to get the boat out
of that boiling surf alive—no, it wasn’t easy.”</p>

<p>Mar caught the first look of keenness that crossed the
tear-stained face—the sudden taut aspect of the slim
little body, and he knew perfectly well that the modest
young navigator before him was saying in his heart, “Ah,
now, if <em>I’d</em> been there.” Thus encouraged, Mar went
on: “Things had been bad enough out in the open sea,
but here you were being driven straight on the rocks, and
the wind—you don’t know anything yet about what the
wind can do when it tries.”</p>

<p>“What kind of fing?”</p>

<p>“It cut the top off those great waves as clean as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
can slice the peak off a hillock of ice-cream; and the
water was hurled at you, not in spray, but in masses,
you know—masses that never broke till they struck the
men or the boat—except when the wind veered, and then
the water masses were flung clean up on the cliffs, as
neatly as you could throw a bottle of soda on our roof
here and never see a drop spilled till the glass burst on
the slates.”</p>

<p>Jack nodded and seemed to forget his twirling, though
he stood with his body slightly askew, ready to begin
again.</p>

<p>“They’d never have got out of that boiling caldron
alive if the wind hadn’t changed.” Mar wagged his
head in a final sort of way, and turned in his revolving
chair to pick up a fallen paper.</p>

<p>“Is vat all? And vey did get home—”</p>

<p>“No, that’s not all, and they didn’t get home. Only
one of them got anywhere.” Mar bent his big body
slightly forward and clasped his hands round the good
knee. The other leg was stretched straight out in front
of him, stiff and lifeless looking.</p>

<p>“They kept afloat for several hours,” he went on,
“only to be wrecked after all, a mile or two beyond an
ugly looking cape called Nome.”</p>

<p>“Wecked! Were vey weally wecked?”</p>

<p>Mar nodded. In an emergency so great Jack did not
scruple to turn his back on the stool of penitence. He
came and planted himself on wide apart legs, directly in
front of Mr. Mar, and stood there waiting. But Mr. Mar
seemed to be thinking less about Jack now, and he stared
steadily at the hole in the carpet.</p>

<p>“What happened to ve little boat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“The little boat was rapidly converted into little
flinders.”</p>

<p>“Ven how could ve men get away again?”</p>

<p>“That’s what one of the men would have liked somebody
to tell him.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t vere any people vere on vat land?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul.”</p>

<p>“Where was ve ovver man?”</p>

<p>“He had been washed out of the boat—he—it was
hard to say where the other man was.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t his fwiend look for him?”</p>

<p>“Not just then. The first thing the friend did was to
tear up his shirt.”</p>

<p>“Gwacious! Was he as mad as vat?”</p>

<p>“No, he wasn’t mad, but he wanted some strips to tie
round a wound he’d got.”</p>

<p>“Oh! And when he’d done vat?”</p>

<p>“Then he went up on the tundra.”</p>

<p>“What’s ve—”</p>

<p>“The tundra is the great, rolling plain. They call it
‘the steppes’ in Siberia. A few inches below the arctic
moss that covers it, it’s frozen, even in summer, as hard
as iron. And it never melts. It’s been frozen like that
for millions of years.”</p>

<p>“Why did ve man want to go up on ve—ve—?”</p>

<p>“Well, he seemed to think he’d like to go to sleep. So
that’s what he did. He slept a long time. When he
woke up he went down to the beach, and the first thing
he saw was his friend. It looked as if the friend had been
sleepy, too. He was taking his ease down there on the
sand, in a tangle of seaweed. His face was hidden. The
other one went down to him, as fast as his wound would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
let him, and he called several times. Then he took hold of
his friend’s shoulder and shook him. But the friend
never stirred—he was dead. Up there, above the line of
seaweed and driftwood, either he or the surf had flung
his rifle—the butt rather battered, but nothing a handy
man couldn’t put right; only a rifle isn’t much good
without cartridges. By and by, the live man dug a grave
for the dead one up above tide line in the sand; and when
he had buried the body, he sat down and wondered how
long it would be before the end would come for himself.
While he sat there tinkering at the rifle, a couple of natives
came down the coast.”</p>

<p>“Cannibals?” In his excitement Jack dropped on the
floor like a small Turk, with his legs curled under him.
But he had steadied his precipitate fall into that position
with a hand on his friend’s leg—and, as ill-luck would
have it, not the good leg, but the stiff, forbidding member
that poor Mar dragged about the world with the
help of his stout walking-stick. Now, to touch that leg
would have been like touching the leg of a table, if somehow
it hadn’t been more like touching a corpse. Jack’s
friend didn’t seem to mind. But the boy felt the contact
the more keenly for the fact that Mar felt it hardly
at all. That was the horror of a wooden leg—that it
couldn’t feel. Jack snatched away his hand as if it had
been burned. But Mar was saying calmly, “Cannibals?
Oh, no. Esquimaux, quite good fellows. They must
have seen white men and firearms before, for they took
a deep interest in the rifle. The castaway made them
understand he was hungry. They nodded and pointed
back the way they had come. The white man got up and
hobbled away with them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“What made him hobble?”</p>

<p>“Oh—a—it’s quite common after a wreck—you’ll
notice people often hobble for a while. Well, they went
along the beach, till they came to a place so rocky it
drove them up on the edge of the tundra; and up there
the white man saw across the plain to the nor’ard, a low
line of hills streaked with snow. And there was one bare
peak in particular that stood out very plain. It looked
only about eight or nine miles away, and you could see
quite well there was something curious about it. Yes,
it was queer.”</p>

<p>“What was ve matter wiv it?”</p>

<p>“It had a curious-shaped top. Even from the coast it
didn’t look natural. You’d swear it was a monument
of some kind. The natives didn’t seem to know
anything about it. There was a river flowing down from
the hills through the tundra to the sea, and all the mouth
of it was choked with driftwood, though there wasn’t a
tree in sight and hadn’t been all along. Beyond the
driftwood, a long sand-spit ran out into the sea, and
spread itself right and left, parallel to the coast, and on
this sand-spit were a lot of little driftwood huts, skin
boats drawn up, and people in fur standing round a fire.
The two Esquimaux took the white man across in a boat,
and told the other Esquimaux about him. And they gave
him some food, fish. Everybody took so much interest in
his rifle that he had to sit on it. They talked a good deal,
but the white man didn’t know what it was all about. So
he ate and slept, and ate and slept, always with his rifle
under his arm. When he got tired of eating and sleeping,
the castaway sat and looked at the sea. Never a sail.
And sometimes he would turn and look at that queer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
peak over beyond the tundra. He gathered that these
people didn’t live here on this sand-spit—they were only
camping. Kind of Esquimaux summer resort. No, they
couldn’t take him to a white settlement. They knew
nothing about any white settlement. Then he would show
them, he said. Let them bring down their best boat, and
he would give his gun to them if they’d take him off
there to the southeast, to St. Michaels. They shook their
heads and bustled away. The white man saw with horror
signs of a beginning to break camp. Where were they
all going? Over the hills? No, on up the coast by sea.
When?” Mar pantomimed their answer—placed his
two hands palm to palm, laid his head down on them
sideways and shut his eyes, opened them briskly, and
took hold of his stick as if about to start on a journey.</p>

<p>Jack was grinning with delight. “Was <em>vat</em> ve way vey
said ‘to-morrow morning?’”</p>

<p>“Just like that. They were going off the very next
day!”</p>

<p>“Not goin’ to leave vat poor man all alone vere, were
vey?”</p>

<p>“No, they seemed quite ready to take the castaway and
his rifle along. But”—Mr. Mar looked so grave that
Jack came closer still—“to go up yonder with them to
their underground winter home seemed to the castaway
almost as horrible as to be left behind. Well, he had a
day anyhow to think it over. His wound was still pretty
painful, but he felt whatever happened, he ought to go
over the tundra to that queer hill and take a look at the
situation from the top. He must have been feverish, or
he’d have realized that he wasn’t fit yet for hard exercise,
and that there wasn’t a ghost of a likelihood of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
settlement on the far side, since these natives knew nothing
about it. Then you see, there was the awful danger
that on this last day a rescue party should sail hopelessly
by while he was away, or a whaling schooner pass, that he
might have hailed. But no. He had got it into his head
that if he could only reach the top of that glacier-carved
height, all his troubles would be at an end. But he did
have the sense to guard against the natives making off
in his absence. He got one of the boys to come along
with him.</p>

<p>“How old was vat boy?”</p>

<p>“Oh—a—about your size, but four or five years older,
and very clever at throwing the bird-dart. No, I’ll tell
you about that another time. They set off across the
tundra. It wasn’t easy walking. It wasn’t walking at
all. It was jumping from one moss knoll to another, or
wading to the knees in the spongy hollows. But he’d
look up at the peak and say: ‘Once I’m <em>there</em>—’ All the
same, he had to call a halt several times. He’d find a
dryish place, and he’d sit down and stare about him.
They had long lost sight of the sand-spit. Even the sea
had disappeared. To right and left, as far as you could
see, tundra, tundra, nothing but tundra, a few pools shining
in the hollows, and acres of sedge and moss, and low-growing
‘scrub-willow.’ Nothing else. Just this featureless
plain till the land met the ocean and the ocean met
the arctic ice. Suddenly, ‘What’s that?’ says the white
man, and he pointed sou’west. The native stared. The
light plays you queer tricks on the tundra. You often
see lakes and ships and cities that aren’t there. But this
didn’t look like a mirage, it was too simple, too distinct.
Just two sticks stuck in the tundra. They might be one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
mile away, they might be ten. But there those sticks
stood as clear against the blue sky as a couple of bean
poles on a prairie farm.”</p>

<p>“Vey <em>weren’t</em> bean poles!” said the prescient listener.</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Mar. “The white man decided it must
be some driftwood contrivance of the natives. Only the
remarkable thing about it was, that he hadn’t noticed it
before. For a thing like that is apt to strike you in a
country where there wasn’t a tree for a hundred and
fifty miles to the south’ard, and not one between you and
the Pole. Well, he felt he’d know more about those
sticks, and he’d know more about a lot besides, when
he’d got to the top of the hill. So they went on; but the
hill was a good way off. The ‘little white patches’ turned
out to be vast fields of rotten snow. You went in up to
your waist. The native jabbered, and seemed to be pointing
out that it was better to go the long way round.
There was less snow, and there didn’t seem to be such a
chaos of talus—broken rock, you know—tumbled down
from the peak. And the peak wasn’t a peak. It was
more like a queer-shaped, flat stone set on a rock pedestal.
‘It’s all right,’ the man kept saying to himself, as
they pushed on, ‘I shall feel it was worth it, once I’m on
the top.’ And they went on and on. All of a sudden the
man looked up, and realized that the feeling that had been
haunting him was justified. The rock up there was like
a giant anvil. So like, it was almost uncanny to think
nature could have carved a stone with such whimsical exactness.
‘Just wait till I get up there,’ he said again,
half-laughing to himself; ‘see if I don’t hammer out
<em>something</em>!’ and he forgot his wound and how it hurt
him to walk, and he jumped across a water hole to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
higher knoll and saw that the ground on the other side
fell gently down to a shallow valley. And the valley held
a little stream in its lap. The white man realized when
he saw that, how thirsty he was. He hadn’t dared to
drink out of the standing pools on the tundra, and he
went as fast as he could away from the anvil, and down
the slope to the running water. He saw a dash of something
white on the edge of the bank, as he hurried down
to the creek, and he knew in the back of his head that it
was a little heap of weather-bleached bones that shone so,
off there in the grass. But he never stopped till he stood
by the bed of the stream. He took up the water in his
double hands and drank. It was good water, and he’d
never been so thirsty before in his life. But the water
spilled away through his fingers, and he felt he should
never get enough. So he balanced himself over some
stones, and he lay on his stomach, and reached his lips to
the clear water. He drank and drank, with his half-shut
eyes fixed on a spark of mica, that caught the light and
was shining like a diamond under the water. No, it
wasn’t mica. He saw plainer now. He leaned over a
little further, and picked the bit of pyrites out of the
wet gravel. The Esquimau boy saw the white man stand
up as suddenly as if he’d been stung. But he held on to
the thing he had taken into his palm, and he lifted his
hand, like this, several times, and he turned the thing
over and over, weighing it. One place in the stained,
brassy-looking thing had been scratched, and every time
the light caught that new abrasion, it glinted. The white
man took out his knife and cut the substance. It was gold!”</p>

<p>“<em>Weal</em> gold?” said Jack Galbraith, gathering up his
sprawled-out body with a squirrel-like quickness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Real gold,” answered Mar. “‘Any more stuff like
this about?’ the white man asked. The native looked at
the nugget, and shrugged indifferently. The white man
dug about in the gravel with his hands and a sharp stone,
and then he sat down and thought, with his eyes on the
place where the nugget had been. The Esquimau boy
got out his bird-dart, and went off a little way after a
jack-snipe. The white man knew he ought to make a
miner’s assay.”</p>

<p>“What’s vat?”</p>

<p>“That’s ‘panning.’ If he’d had a round pan like
Sigma’s bread pan, he’d have put some sand and gravel
in it, and he would fill it to the brim with water, and
he’d wash the sand and gravel round and round, picking
out all the stones and letting off the water little by little,
with a circular motion—so. And all the lighter sand and
stuff would get washed out; and by and by, if the miner
knows his business, any gold that may have been in that
sand, every particle, is left behind in the bottom of the
pan.”</p>

<p>“Gwacious! Vat <em>would</em> be luck!” said Jack, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t luck. It’s skill and specific gravity.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t ve man twy it?”</p>

<p>“He hadn’t any pan. He hadn’t even a shovel. I’ve
seen it done very cleverly with a shovel. I’ve seen it
done with a saucer. He had nothing. How was he going
to find out if there was any more of that stuff there? Had
this one nugget by any chance been dropped? No, that
was absurd. Who could have dropped it? But he looked
up the bank where the bones shone, and out of the coarse
grass a skull grinned at him. Not a wolf’s skull, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
deer’s, as he’d thought. A human being’s—a white
man’s, perhaps. Had the nugget belonged to him? Had
he brought it from some valley far away, and lost his bit
of gold as well as his life here under the shadow of the
great stone anvil? The graver the man got down there
by the water, the broader the one on the bank seemed to
grin. Suddenly the living man got up, and ran toward
that heap of bones as if he couldn’t rest till he’d found
out what the joke was the dead man was laughing at. He
picked up the skull, and he saw it was a white man’s.”</p>

<p>“How could he see vat?”</p>

<p>“He looked at the teeth. They were splendid. Good
as any savage’s—all but one—one was filled. When he
saw that, the castaway knew that probably this white
man, who had been here before him, had dropped that
nugget in the creek—or it had been washed down there
after the wolves had torn the dead man’s clothes. But who
could tell! ‘Look here,’ the live man asked, ‘what <em>did</em>
happen?’ But the other wouldn’t say a word, just went
on grinning in that irritating way of his. So the live
man picked up two stones, and got out his big clasp-knife,
and he went at that skull with might and main,
sawing at it with the knife (which was no good at all),
and hammering with first one stone and then another,
working away like one possessed.”</p>

<p>“Did he weally fink he could make ve skull tell him
somefing?” and Jack Galbraith laughed aloud at so foolish
an adventurer.</p>

<p>“Seemed as if he thought he’d get <em>some</em> satisfaction
out of it, from the way he kept on. By the time the Esquimau
boy got back with the jack-snipe, the white man
had hammered away everything from that skull except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the round basin of the cranium—this part, you know.
The Esquimau boy was horrified, and made signs of disapproval.</p>

<p>“‘Just you wait,’ said the white man. He took the
bone bowl down to the bank. He filled it full, and three
times he ‘panned’ the gravel of that creek. <em>And every
time he got gold!</em>”</p>

<p>“Gwacious!” said Jack, in an excited whisper.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Mr. Mar, “when he saw colors the third
time he just poured the stuff wet into his handkerchief,
and told the Esquimau boy he was ready to go now. As
he went up the bank, he passed the bones again. ‘I wonder
if he knew!’ the castaway thought, and as he went on
he thought more and more, and he got solemner and
solemner. He said to himself: ‘A gold mine will do me
just about as much good as it did Old Bones, if I have to
stay up here with the Esquimaux. We’ll go back the
other way,’ he called to the boy, and the boy didn’t
think much of the plan. But the white man kept looking
all round in every direction, to see if there was the least
little trail leading anywhere, or the smallest human sign.
Only those bones shining so white down there on the bank!
The castaway went on, feeling pretty sick and anxious,
till he looked straight up and saw off there against the
blue, that great anvil, plainer than ever. The nose quite
sharp and finely cut, the top as flat as our dining-table,
and the waist gouged in exactly as a real anvil is. ‘Well,
I won’t give up going to the top,’ he said out loud, ‘and
if there <em>are</em> any settlements—’ It was a crazy thing to
do, but he did it; and when he got to the top he saw
something he wouldn’t have seen in time, if he hadn’t
climbed Anvil Rock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did he see?” Jack gathered together his
sprawled-out body and sat up.</p>

<p>Mar’s eyes looked over the little boy’s head into space.
“No settlements. Beyond the creek, barren hills to the
north. No hope that way. East and west the tundra
stretched to the horizon line level as the ocean. No hope
right or left. He turned round and saw off there to the
south the coast where he’d been wrecked, and the sand-spit
the Esquimaux were making ready to leave, and beyond
that, against the horizon—what was that! He
nearly fell off the rock. For a two-masted schooner was
lying a couple of miles off the shore. Two masts! It
flashed over him those were the two poles he’d seen
sticking up above the tundra, several hours before. Well,
he got down off that rock double quick, and he nearly
killed himself tearing back to the coast, and signaling the
ship. He was only just in time—they were weighing anchor.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jack, with a long breath of relief, “it
<em>was</em> a good fing he climbed vat funny hill!”</p>

<p>“Y—yes,” said Nathaniel Mar. His tone was hardly
satisfactory.</p>

<p>“Didn’t he get back to his fwiends all wight?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he got back all right.”</p>

<p>“What did vey say when he told vem about ve gold?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t tell anybody about that just then.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“If he had, somebody might have rushed there and
cleaned the whole creek out, before he had a chance.”</p>

<p>“Oh! How soon did he go back?”</p>

<p>“He—he didn’t go.”</p>

<p>Jack sat there wide-eyed. “W—why didn’t he?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;" id="illus2">

<p class="caption">“Mar’s eyes looked over the little boy’s head into space”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you see, he had a pretty bad time with that leg
of his.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was his leg, was it?”</p>

<p>“A—yes—his leg. He kept waiting for the doctors to
cure it. Instead of curing it they kept cutting off little
bits of it.”</p>

<p>“Ow! Well—and after vat, when it <em>did</em> get well.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t.”</p>

<p>“And was he lame always, like you?”</p>

<p>“Something like me.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t <em>he</em> get a store leg, too?”</p>

<p>“He did, I believe—ultimately.”</p>

<p>“And wasn’t it any good?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t quite the same as the one he’d lost.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no.” Jack realized that, with a creep down his
back. He could still feel the dreadful touch of it on his
fingers. “But I suppose he sent somebody else up after
vat gold?”</p>

<p>“N-no.”</p>

<p>“Well, what <em>did</em> he do?”</p>

<p>“He—he got married.”</p>

<p>“Oh—h. And after vat?”</p>

<p>“Then he got a post of some sort—not easy to get, still
harder to leave.”</p>

<p>“And—”</p>

<p>“And then he got some children. Oh, he was always
getting things, that fellow! Once it was intermittent
fever. Anyhow he had to stay where he was.”</p>

<p>“Ven who got ve gold?”</p>

<p>“Nobody. Not yet.”</p>

<p>“Ve gold is waitin’ vere now?” Jack jumped to his
feet with dancing eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“So—a—so he says.”</p>

<p>“Oh—<em>oh</em>!” Then with an air of fiery impatience:</p>

<p>“What you say vat man’s doin’ now?”</p>

<p>“He—well—I understand he’s hanging on to that
post.”</p>

<p>“Hangin’ on a post!” Jack colored as Mar laughed,
and added hurriedly, “Just waitin’ to see if vat leg
won’t get better, I s’pose.”</p>

<p>“Waiting for—several things.”</p>

<p>Jack came closer. “Oh, <em>doesn’t</em> he mean to never
mind his leg, and go back some day?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if he had times of thinking
he would go back <em>somehow</em>. After he’s educated his
children, and got them off his hands, and can afford to
take risks. Or, if the worst comes to the worst, his sons
will go one day.”</p>

<p>“Or <em>I</em> might go,” said Jack, quickly.</p>

<p>Mar smiled and fell silent. Jack walked away with his
hands in his breeches pockets, and his eyes big with
dreams. The opening of the door made them both start.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you not to get out of that chair till
supper?” Mrs. Mar demanded. She stood there with the
butter dish in one hand and the milk pitcher in the other,
snapping her bright eyes at the culprit.</p>

<p>He for his part had turned about sharply, and he fell
from the infinite skies with a bump.</p>

<p>“I—I—” he stammered, backing against the bookcase.</p>

<p>“It’s on the lower shelf,” said Mar, calmly. “The
heavy brown book.” Jack turned again, utterly bewildered,
but following the direction indicated by Mr. Mar’s
walking-stick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s ‘Franklin’s Second Voyage,’ next the dictionary.
Yes, that’s what I want. I think,” he went
on to his wife, as Jack stooped to obey him, “I think I
must always keep a small prisoner in here, to hand me
things out of my reach.”</p>

<p>She answered nothing as she set down the butter and
the milk, but she kept her eyes on Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he was saying hurriedly, “vis is Fwanklin.”
He carried the book to his friend.</p>

<p>“Fwanklin!” repeated that gentleman with affectation
of scorn, as he opened the book. “Now, sir, go back
to your seat and practice your R’s. It’s ridiculous for a
boy of your age to be talking baby talk.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Jack, getting very red as he returned
to his place. Mrs. Mar stood at the sideboard making a
dressing for the salad. Every now and then she looked
over her shoulder. But Jack sat impeccable in the penitential
chair, saying softly, but with careful emphasis:</p>

<p>“Awound ve wugged wocks ve wagged wascal wan.
Awound ve,”—but his eyes were too shining to show a
mind properly bent upon the course pursued by that particular
wascal.</p>

<p>After supper, while Mrs. Mar was putting Trennor
and Harry to bed, Jack Galbraith looked everywhere he
could think of for his book. No, Mr. Mar hadn’t seen it.
“Here, I’ll lend you mine. You’ll understand some of
the chapter about,”—and he turned the pages till he
found the place, and he put in a slip of paper. “There!
Franklin didn’t find what he was looking for, but he’s
written the best travel book I know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, fank you, sir.” Jack took the big volume in
both arms, and was making off with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“And look here, Jack, about that other fellow—the
man who did find something up there, you and I won’t
tell anybody about that.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” He stopped and nodded at Mar over the great
book. “All wight. But I may speak to <em>you</em> about it
sometimes—”</p>

<p>“When we’re alone.”</p>

<p>“All wight. Hasn’t he,” Jack lowered his tone to
conspirator’s pitch, “hasn’t he ever told anybody but
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s told one or two. But in confidence, you
know. People he can trust.”</p>

<p>Jack pulled himself up proudly. “I can keep secrets
like anyfing.” But again he lowered his voice, and smiling
delightedly, “What do vey say,” he demanded with
lively anticipation, “vose ovvers, when vey hear about
it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Mar did not answer instantly.</p>

<p>Jack drew nearer, still clasping the great book. “Oh,
<em>do</em> tell me what vey say.”</p>

<p>“They—they think he dreamed it.”</p>

<p>“B—b—but,” Jack stuttered with indignation,
“doesn’t he show vem ve nugget, and ve handkerchief
wiv ve—”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mar, sadly. “He lost that handkerchief
somewhere on the tundra.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-n.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Not for several years had Mar made mention
of the far northern experience which, beside
laming him for life, had as yet but one visible
effect upon his circumstances—that of
ruining his credit as a man of judgment
among those nearest to him.</p>

<p>People had recognized Nathaniel Mar as one marked
out for misfortune, when, upon his father’s death, he had
been obliged to give up his theological studies, and come
back from college, to take the first thing that offered him
a little ready money for the assistance of his mother. His
modest salary as surveyor’s clerk was presently augmented,
in recognition of his good draftsmanship and
his surprisingly quick mastery of the new field. But it
was not till the work he did the following year, over
in the Rock Hill district, brought him the friendship of
the prosperous young mine owner Galbraith, that Mar
found an opportunity of following the more scientific
side of his new profession. It was Galbraith who got
him the post on the Coast Survey, that led to Mar’s joining
the Russian-American Expedition.</p>

<p>After his return the handsome schoolmistress, who had
reluctantly said “no” to the penniless surveyor, consented
to look with favor upon the Discoverer of Gold in
the new territory of Alaska.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>But she warmly opposed Mar’s design of going to Rock
Hill to share the great secret with his friend Galbraith.
No, indeed! The Rock Hill mining magnate was in small
need of “tips.” It was clearly Mar’s duty to give the
men of Miss Trennor’s family the first chance of joining
in this glorious scheme that was to enrich them all.</p>

<p>When Harriet Trennor called the Trennor brothers
“the men of her family,” she made the most of what was
a second cousinship. It was even the case that she was
not on very good terms with those go-ahead young gentlemen;
for the Trennors, in spite of their prosperity,
had never, as she expressed it, “done anything” for her.
It had been for the sake of her old father that they had
bestirred themselves sufficiently to recommend Harriet
for the post of assistant superintendent of the Girls’ College
of Valdivia. But after providing her with an opportunity
to leave their common birthplace in St. Joseph,
Missouri, the Trennors and their respective wives had, in
point of fact, neglected Miss Harriet to such a degree,
that there would be a certain magnificence in her heaping
coals of fire on their heads. She, the poor relation,
whom they had so little regarded, would put it in the way
of men merely well-off to become millionaires. They
would learn her worth at last!</p>

<p>Yes, yes, Nathaniel must keep the great secret close, till
the Trennors (who were in New York on their yearly business
trip) should have returned. But the affairs of the
brothers took them to Mexico, and their home coming was
further delayed.</p>

<p>While they tarried acute pneumonia appeared upon
the Rock Hill scene, and carried off John Galbraith. Little
part in Mar’s grief at the loss of his best-loved friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was played by the thought that now he could not count
upon his “backing.” Galbraith took with him out of the
world something that to a man of Mar’s temperament
meant more. And at that time he looked upon himself
as possessor of a secret that any capitalist in the
country would hold himself lucky to share. It was not
till the return of his wife’s cousins that he found there
could be exceptions to this foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>As enterprising dabblers in real estate and mining,
and with the Palmas Valley Bank behind them, the Trennor
brothers were constantly being approached by people
with schemes for making millions. Such persons, though
almost invariably as poor as Mar, were not often, the
Trennor brothers agreed, ready with propositions so fantastic.</p>

<p>Alaska was in those days further away from men’s imaginations
than Patagonia. The few people who had anything
to say about the newly acquired territory, used it
only as a club to belabor the then secretary of state.
What had he been thinking of to advise his foolish country
to pay seven millions for the barren rocks and worthless
ice-fields that astute Russia, after one hundred and
twenty-six years’ attempt at occupation, was so ready to
abandon!</p>

<p>“Worthless!” retorted Secretary Seward’s friends.
“Why, the Seal Islands alone—”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, the Seal Islands <em>are</em> alone on the credit side
of the transaction. Seward gave those seven millions for
the two little Pribyloffs, and the value of Alaska may be
gaged by the fact that it was just thrown in.”</p>

<p>Was it to be believed, the Trennors asked, was it
<em>likely</em> there was gold in a place where fellows with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
keen noses as the Russians—they shook their heads. Both
of them shook their heads, for the Trennor brothers always
did everything together. Who could believe it had
been left for a man like Mar—besides, that gold should
be up there was dead against the best geologic opinion of
the day. The precious metal had never been found under
these conditions. There were reasons, scientific reasons,
as anybody but Mar would know, why gold
couldn’t exist in just that formation (they spoke as if
the vast new realm boasted but one). And, finally, even
if there <em>was</em> gold in such a place, how the dickens was it
going to be got out?</p>

<p>It was in the talk about mining facilities that Mar’s
own faith suffered the first of many hurts.</p>

<p>He was obliged to concede that these astute young men
were well-informed as regards the difficulties and disappointments
of mining, even in a land where transport
was easy, food cheap, and labor plentiful—a land blessed
by running water and perpetual summer. No less was
Mar constrained to admit that this gold he believed he
had found was hidden in a barren corner of the uttermost
North, where not even an occasional tree promised
timber for sluice boxes, where the winter was nine
months long, and where, even in summer, the soil six
inches below the surface was welded with the frost of
ages.</p>

<p>They were surprised, the Trennors said, that any one
should expect them to take stock in such a—</p>

<p>Oh, he didn’t (Mar hastened to defend himself), he
didn’t at all expect—it was only that his wife had
begged him to come to them first.</p>

<p>And they smiled. They always smiled when Mar’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
mad notion was mentioned. Even after it ceased to be
actually mentioned, they had for his mere name a particular
kind of tolerant, distant-cousin-by-marriage smile
that said “poor Mar,” with an accent on the adjective.</p>

<p>The new Mrs. Mar was at first boundlessly indignant
with her kinsmen. “Never mind,” she adjured her husband,
with flashing eyes; as soon as he should be able to
travel, they would go up there themselves. She seemed
unobservant of the fact that his spirits were not raised
by her kind proposition. They would have no trouble,
she assured him, in finding worthier partners to join
them in the great scheme when once they had “made
sure.”</p>

<p>“Made sure?” said Mar, wincing; “but I <em>have</em> made
sure.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course. Still you did lose the nugget—and
the gold dust, too.”</p>

<p>For the first time Mar changed the subject.</p>

<p>“You haven’t anything <em>to show</em>,” she persisted. To
which he answered nothing.</p>

<p>Shortly after they were married, Mar’s mother became
very ill. The following spring she died. Mar’s own
health and spirits were a good deal lowered by the surgical
torment he was called on periodically to undergo, as
amputation followed amputation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, without waiting to “go up there and make
sure,” two efforts on Mrs. Mar’s part to interest moneyed
men in her husband’s discovery, resulted not alone in
failing to convince any one else that this was a fine opportunity
for investment, but ultimately in undermining
her own faith.</p>

<p>With the coming of her first child she prepared to cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
overboard the wild hope (she saw now that it <em>was</em> wild)
of a fortune up yonder in the ice-fields, and showed herself
wisely ready to make what she could out of the saner
possibilities life presented in Valdivia. Her cousins had
been right. She wouldn’t admit it to them—not yet—but
it was a crazy scheme, that notion of gold in the
arctic regions!</p>

<p>Dreamer as he was, Mar missed nothing of the intended
effect when she first ceased to talk about his discovery—ceased
to plan all life with that fact for its corner-stone.
Her initial silence hurt him probably more
than the half-veiled taunts of a later time. It was all the
difference between the shrinking of an open wound and
the dull beating of an ancient cicatrice.</p>

<p>Not only, as time went on, did she resent the illusion
she had been under, but, as is common with women of
her type, her husband’s greater significance since motherhood
had come to her, made her increasingly dread that
foolish infatuation of his. She foresaw that a continued
faith in the value of his “find” would stand between him
and energetic pursuit of fortune in any other direction.
So it was that the North was not merely for her, as time
went on, the type of a shattered dream—it came to be
her and her babies’ rival in this man’s thoughts. This
man—who owed to them all his thoughts, all his faith
and energy—he was divided in his allegiance.</p>

<p>And not in dreams alone might he desert them. He
might even conceivably insist, against all rational advice
and plain duty, he might insist on going back there!
The mere idea of his fatuous clinging to the old plan
came to exercise over her an almost uncanny power for
misery. Not that he continued openly to admit his preoccupation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
But it was there—she was sure of that—in
his head, more properly in his heart, his refuge, his darling,
his delight. She came to feel for it the hatred, and
to have before it the involuntarily nerve recoil, that lies
for some wives in the thought of another woman. What
if she never succeeded in rooting the fancy out of his
brain? How was she at least to make sure of preventing
his squandering time and money in pursuit of it?—now,
when she could not go too, and when his going would
mean (as she honestly thought) disaster to her and to
the children and the humiliation of falling back for cousinly
help on those wise young Missourians, who had seen
at once the madness of the scheme.</p>

<p>She patched up the breach with her two kinsmen, and
induced them to offer her husband a small position in
their bank.</p>

<p><em>That</em> would hold him.</p>

<p>But although she succeeded in seeing the cripple made
teller—as a first step, she was firmly convinced, on the
road to a partnership—she was not delivered from her
fear. The unspoken dread that he might throw aside the
humble, though precious, “sure thing” for this chimera
beckoning from the North—the dread of it became the
main factor in their spiritual relation. For not only did
she never free herself from her grudging love of the man—and
never, therefore, from her shrinking at the prospect
of separation—not only did she conceive of him in
the American way as the property of his family and
bound as bondsmen are to serve them to the end, but in
addition to all that, more and more as the years went on,
did she come profoundly to disbelieve in the validity of
his story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you still think you may go back there one day?”
she burst out on one occasion, looking darkly at the reconnaissance
map that hung on the dining-room wall.
Mar mumbled something about the satisfaction in the
verifying of an impression.</p>

<p>“Verifying <em>what</em>? How do you verify pure fancy?”
Then turning suddenly upon him, “If ever you do go,
you’ll only be giving a fantastic reason for a restless
man’s longing to leave his home.”</p>

<p>At moments conceived by her to be critical, she would
toss at him the reproach of his well-known visionariness,
and all their old foolish hope and its utter loss would be
held up to scorn in her saying, apropos of something
quite foreign: “That’s like some one I once knew who
wanted people to believe in a miracle. But not without
proof, he said. He <em>had</em> proof—absolute proof—only he’d
lost it.” Or, less offensive, but for Mar no less pointed,
the form of skepticism his loss of the nugget had crystallized
for her, “You’ve got to have something to <em>show</em>
to a Missourian.”</p>

<p>This was later not only adopted by her boys as a favorite
family gibe, but introduced into their school, and
thence spread abroad as a foolish and pointless saying
sometimes will, no one quite knowing why, till all of that
generation, whatever their origin, would say with a wag
of the head: “You’ve got to <em>show</em> me—I’m from Missouri,”
whenever they wished to announce themselves
acute fellows by no means to be taken in.</p>

<p>As to the particular matter that gave rise to the saying,
Mrs. Mar’s strong personal feeling about it was augmented
by outside circumstances. Stories of failure in
gold mining were too rife and too well-attested not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
have a significance difficult to disregard. Blameless misfortune
as well as wholesale swindling, were so much the
order of the day in the West, that men of business like
the Trennors, when they wanted to promote some mining
scheme, must needs have recourse to the gorgeous East.
New York had plenty of money for “wildcat” schemes.
But no place, the wise would tell you, like conservative
old Boston for floating a risky concern. New Englanders
were at that distance which lends enchantment. For
them gold mining is still a form of romance—the mere
thought of it goes to the head like wine.</p>

<p>But Valdivia was neither near enough to the mining
centers to catch the fever, nor yet so far away but what
her citizens mightily feared infection. Had not their
townsman, Ben White, lost his head and his fortune over
at Huerfano Creek? Wasn’t there young Andrews for
a warning!</p>

<p>No catastrophe of this kind in their little world lost
through Mrs. Mar’s agency any of its ironic usefulness as
illustration. She succeeded not only in making her husband
doubt the wisdom of giving up a sure thing in the
bank, to claim an unworkable gold mine, but little by
little, as the rain and the weather wear away the sharp
outlines of a stone inscription, so for Nathaniel Mar the
years and the unbelief about him brought a gradual blurring
of the picture, till even to himself its early outlines
were a little dimmed.</p>

<p>To revive its actuality, more than for any other purpose,
nearly ten years after he had told the story to little
Jack Galbraith, he told it again to Mr. Elihu H. Cox.
The man listened with such a look in his big, fishy eyes,
in a silence so galling, that Mar interposed hurriedly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
“And there’s one capital thing about it. It’s safe
enough. If the gold’s there, it certainly won’t run
away,” and abruptly changed the subject; though to
hear himself saying “if it’s there,” rankled in his memory
like apostasy. He would never tell the story again
till his boys were grown and he told it to them. <em>They</em>
would believe him. They, with youth and four sound
legs between them, they would go up there and justify
the long faith.</p>

<p>For fear that he might die before they were old enough
to be indoctrinated, he wrote out as circumstantial an
account as he could between intervals of black despair at
finding how dim were certain details. He grappled with
the horror and saw it recede before the draftsman’s skill
and his peerless satisfaction in preparing careful diagrams
and a map to larger scale. There was an effect of
mathematical accuracy about these illustrations of his
account that gave him back his confidence. If there was
any trifling difference between these data and those furnished
upon his return, the apparent discrepancy lay in
the essential impressionism of mere words. The compass
and the rule can’t lie. He put the precious document
away with his will, in the vault of the Palmas Valley
Bank, but he did not put away the thought of it. On the
contrary, he kept it by him day and night, turning it
over in his mind with the rich comfort of the man who
reflects that he will leave to his children a handsome inheritance
and a fund of gratitude. Something in this
case that partook of the nature of a paternal life-insurance—the
kind of thing that had not profited, could not
profit the giver, except as it profited him to feel that for
all his appearance of being one of life’s failures, he yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
had insured his children against the meaner assaults of
fortune. For this “policy” that he held for them was
“paid up.” Oh, yes, Nathaniel Mar had paid heavily—not
yearly, but daily, almost hourly, for his lien upon the
riches of the North.</p>

<p>The thought of the gold-shotted creek between the
Great Stone Anvil and the arctic circle comforted him
not least when he looked at his little daughter. It was
good to know—the knowledge helped him through many
a difficult hour—that Hildegarde would never be forced
to join the ever fuller ranks of the bread-winning
women. It would be no hurt to her that, however great
an heiress she might be, she had been frugally brought
up.</p>

<p>There was something large and fine and tranquil about
the Scandinavian-looking girl, whom her parents had
called by the stately northern name with more luck than
attends many a christening—since it is well-known Victoria
is, like as not, to take on an aspect depressed and
down-trodden; Grace to turn out clumsy and hideous;
while Ivy shows a sturdy independence, and Blanche and
Lily grows swarthy as a squaw.</p>

<p>But the fact was that the little Mar girl was named
Harriet Hildegarde, and was even called “Hattie” till
she was nearly twelve, when, after remarking one day,
“I don’t look like a Hattie, and I’m not going to be a
Hattie,” she refused thereafter to hear the obnoxious diminutive
and quietly but firmly coerced her family and
her schoolmates into saying “Hildegarde,” if they
wanted her to notice them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar was grieved to find that her only daughter
had no conspicuous talents, and was not even a girl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
spirit—lacked, moreover, the will to cultivate that affectation
of being spirited, which goes in America by the
name of “brightness.” But she was not a bad sort of
little girl after all; she got her lessons, and played games
with a certain boyish gusto, and gardened with a patient
devotion that her mother thought worthy of a better
cause. But Mrs. Mar consoled herself for the girl’s lack
of brilliancy by reflecting that Hildegarde was probably
going to be handsome and that men were great donkeys
and might never find out that she was slow.</p>

<p>Hildegarde herself was conscious of her shortcomings—without
the knowledge overwhelming her. Life
was going to be very good, even if she wasn’t at the head
of the class, or a shining light at the school commencements.
She had no talent for music, and quite as little
for recitation. It was something to hear her saying, in
the famous garden scene—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Geh’ falsche gleissnerische Königin</div>
<div class="verse">Wie du die Welt so täusch’ ich Dich—”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">in a tone of unruffled courtesy and with a brow serene.
When the fiery Madeleine Smulsky took her off with,
“This is Hildegarde laying dark plots—now she’s doing
foul murder,” and proceeded to translate her friend’s
large tranquillity into the feverish terms of picturesque
wickedness, the effect was distinctly diverting. Even
Hildegarde laughed. For she got over “minding.” It
was when she was quite little that she had suffered most,
and from the scorn of her own family. Her brothers
were both “such very bright boys,” and her mother she
knew to be enormously clever. It had been painful to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
feel that beside these richly dowered ones, she was “next
door to an idiot.” She made no outward struggle
against the verdict of her family, accepting it as many
a young creature will, without a doubt of its being as
just as final. But, fortunately, hers was a nature too
sane and sunny for her to run the risk many children do
of coming nervously to dread, and so making true, a
prophecy having no foundation in necessity. When she
discovered that she had competent hands—hands with
which she could perform all manner of pleasant domestic
miracles—that gradually, and because of her, the house
was transformed and the garden made to smile; that,
moreover (assuring her of a hold upon the fine arts, too),
she could tell ghost stories that made her school friends
gibber with excitement, the girl felt agreeably conscious
that her destiny after all was maybe larger than the
family eye had been able to discern.</p>

<p>When Hildegarde was sixteen a new pupil appeared at
the Valdivia School for Young Ladies. A little girl
hardly twelve, delicate, pretty, appealing, yet self-sufficing;
so backward in some of her studies, and so advanced
in others, that she could not be entered in either
the upper primary or lower academic classes, but was
sent to recite arithmetic and geography with the infants,
Latin with the first academic girls, and French with the
second collegiates—young ladies four to six years older
than little Bella Wayne.</p>

<p>She was a boarder, and it was said her parents had put
her under the special care of Miss Gillow, the principal.
She even had special dishes cooked for her, and the fact
that these “milk puddings” (as it seemed they were
called) were plainer than the food set before the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
boarders, did nothing to mitigate the offensiveness of the
distinction. Certainly the principal accorded the “new
girl” so many privileges that a strong party sprang up
against her.</p>

<p>Hildegarde, even before a certain day of wrath, had
found herself unconsciously absorbed in watching this
thin slip of prettiness, who looked as if a puff of wind
would blow her away, who ought to have carried herself
humbly, if not actually depressed, in her capacity of unclassifiable
new-comer, and who yet walked about with
her little nose in the air, as if she despised Valdivia, and
especially scorned the critical young ladies of Valdivia’s
celebrated school.</p>

<p>It did not help her good standing that she showed herself
indifferent to an opportunity of joining the Busy
Bees. Now, the Busy Bees were a very popular organization
which not only sewed on alternate Saturday afternoons
at the rectory, but danced with an equal regularity,
in various other places, and organized a bazaar once a
year in the Masonic Hall. Besides the gaiety of this
function, there was a fine flavor of philanthropy about
the regular application of the proceeds to the clothing
and educating of a little Hindu girl, who was able
strangely soon to write pious letters to the young ladies
of Valdivia—letters in which she seemed to get even with
her benefactors by saying that she never forgot to pray
for them. The Bees had had the joy of deciding by what
name their protégé should be christened. As there were
three Marys and six Trennors among them, the little
Hindu was called Mary Trennor, and every properly constituted
girl felt pledged for Mary Trennor’s material
and spiritual welfare—that is, every girl in Valdivia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
whose fortunate social condition permitted her to aspire
to wear the badge of the Golden Bee. It followed that
the new girl was not properly constituted when she
declined the honor. It was even apparent that her heart
was not in the right place. For when Beatrice Trennor
most forbearingly showed the new girl the framed
photograph of the Hindu convert, in order to stimulate
interest in the cause, Miss Bella Wayne turned from it
with the observation, “She’s ugly. I shan’t do a single
thing for such a hideous little girl. I don’t think they
ought to be encouraged.”</p>

<p>It was plain, therefore, that she thought too much of
good looks, and was a stony-hearted monster.</p>

<p>“Serves her right,” said primaries, academics and
collegiates all with one voice, when Bella Wayne, having
for a week daily put the arithmetic class to shame, was
banished to Miss MacIver’s room to spend two hours in
austere solitude over the lesson of the day.</p>

<p>Hildegarde had got special permission to go for ten
minutes after school hours to visit Madeleine Smulsky
(also a boarder), who was in bed with a violent cold.
Coming down-stairs, as Hildegarde passed Miss MacIver’s
room she saw the door cautiously open. A spectacled
eye gleamed strangely low down in the aperture
for one of Miss MacIver’s height, and then the owner of
the eye, as if reassured by the look of things outside,
opened the door a little wider, and the apparition stood
fully revealed. Miss MacIver, many inches shorter than
anybody had ever seen her before, and narrowed in proportion,
the familiar crochet shawl hanging dowdily
over one shoulder, the stiff-held head ornamented with
the front of sandy curls, a gouty finger held crookedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
up, the effect of cold in the nose faithfully reproduced as
the voice twanged out:</p>

<p>“Neow young ladies, observe—” It was the arithmetic
teacher to the life, only it was Bella Wayne, with
her perky little nose supporting huge round spectacles,
and her baby mouth pursed in severity repeating the
rule, “One or bore of the decibal divisiods of a unid are
galled a decibal fragtion.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde had stopped, stared, and was seized with
uncontrollable giggles. Madeleine Smulsky, hearing
these demonstrations, got up out of bed and made all
haste to thrust her bare toes through the banisters, and
crane a tousled head far enough over the rail to discover
what was happening below. Her ecstatic merriment induced
Miss Wayne to come further into the hall, and
reprove her with a supple young finger stiffly crooked,
and speaking not only with a cold in the head, but with
that intolerable click in the nose of the sufferer from
chronic catarrh—</p>

<p>“I would lige yeou do observe there is a sbezial beaudy
aboud the laws of bathebadigs—” Again the dreadful
noise in the impudent little nose. Madeleine’s attempt
to suppress her laughter brought on a fit of coughing,
which, with a spasmodic suddenness, choked and died in
her throat. For all of a sudden there were three figures
in the hall below, and one of them was the real Miss MacIver,
saying to herself in miniature:</p>

<p>“And now, Miss Wayne, you may take off my shawl,
and my skirt, and my glasses.” (Not a syllable about
the opulent front.) “And in ten minutes go and report
to the principal.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;" id="illus3">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="450" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“It was the teacher of arithmetic to the life, only it was
Bella Wayne”</p>
</div>

<p>As the real Miss MacIver, six feet of indignation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
turned away trembling with fury, she looked back an instant
over her shoulder to say: “You or I, Biss Wayne,
bust leave Valdivia—”</p>

<p>But Bella had already vanished into the room of penitence,
and was feverishly pulling off her strange habiliments.
The bare toes of Miss Smulsky had been hurriedly
withdrawn from between the banisters, and any
girl but Hildegarde Mar would have been fleeing down
the staircase, “and so home.” But she walked quietly
away, her large deliberateness even a little emphasized
as she went, weighed down by fearful speculation as to
what form of retribution would overtake the wicked, new
girl.</p>

<p>Hildegarde went to school the next morning ten minutes
earlier than usual. No one yet in the big school-room,
so she wandered restlessly through the empty halls,
wishing she dared go up-stairs and compare notes with
Madeleine. From a window at the back, looking out on
a group of eucalyptus trees and a mass of syringa, she
saw little Bella Wayne sitting very subdued on the topmost
of two stone steps; slate on knee and pencil poised,
but eyes fastened on a woodpecker tap-tap-tapping at the
tree.</p>

<p>Hildegarde went out and spoke kindly to the unlucky
little girl. “What’s happened since—?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much,” and Bella put up her chin.</p>

<p>“Are you—are you going away?”</p>

<p>“Me? No.” And with that she dropped her slate and
pencil on the step, dropped her face into her two hands,
and wept.</p>

<p>Hildegarde thought she had misheard—it must be
that Bella was crying because she was expelled. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
all Hildegarde had expected she would be expelled.
What she had not expected was that she, one of the big
girls, would be so sorry to hear that this was the last she
should see of little Bella Wayne. Hildegarde picked up
the broken slate, and tried to think of something comforting.</p>

<p>“I was <em>sure</em> they’d send me home,” Bella sobbed.
“But they w-won’t! Not even if I d-don’t beg her p-par-don.”</p>

<p>“And you <em>want</em> to be sent home!”</p>

<p>“Of course!” Bella got out a handkerchief three
inches square and dabbed her eyes.</p>

<p>“Was that why you did it?”</p>

<p>“No. It <em>would</em> have been if I’d thought she’d come
and catch me. But—no—I did it because—oh, because
there wasn’t any other earthly thing to do in that
room!” she said, with a burst. Then, more collectively:
“Were you ever in Miss MacIver’s room?”</p>

<p>“No. I’ve always been rather afraid of Miss MacIver.”</p>

<p>“Well, wait till you’ve seen her room—and her
family! You’ll be ’fraider than ever. The only pictures
she has in there are photographs of a lot of nightmarey
people all just like her. Oh, it was dreadful being
shut up there with millions of MacIvers! I did everything
I could think of to forget ’em. I looked at all her
dull books. Then I smelt all her bottles—<em>they</em> aren’t
so dull. Do you know she’s got seventeen on her wash-stand?”</p>

<p>“Not bottles!”</p>

<p>“Bottles. When I’d smelt them all—some very queer—what
else <em>was</em> there to take your mind off those pictures
but to try on her things?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>The three-minute bell began to ring, and Hildegarde
went back to the school-room.</p>

<p>Bella did not reappear among her kind for twenty-four
hours. Some said she’d already gone home. Others
said no, she was waiting till her mother came for her.
Certainly Miss MacIver made no sign; but her cold
seemed better.</p>

<p>Upon resuming her place the next day, Bella, still
with her nose in the air, publicly announced that she had
begged Miss MacIver’s pardon.</p>

<p>“How did they make you do it?” Hildegarde asked
the little girl at recess.</p>

<p>The wicked Miss Wayne was again sitting solitary on
the stone steps among the shrubbery at the back, holding
on her knees a new slate, the lower part covered with
neat little figures—the upper elegantly decorated with
dragons.</p>

<p>“<em>No</em>body made me,” answered Bella, while she carefully
shaded the scaly coil on the monster’s tail. “The
door was a little bit open—Miss MacIver’s door—and I
saw her packing up. Then she looked out and caught me
peeking at her.”</p>

<p>“Heavens!” breathed Hildegarde, so overcome she sat
down. “What happened then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I went in.”</p>

<p>“She called you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t go in without being made to?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“Gracious! How <em>could</em> you, Bella?”</p>

<p>“I thought I’d better. I went in and asked her pardon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did she say?”</p>

<p>“She just”—the outrageous Bella made the obnoxious
clicking in her nose. “Do you know she’s only got two
dresses?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve noticed.”</p>

<p>“But she’s very well off for fronts.”</p>

<p>“Is she?”</p>

<p>Bella nodded. “Got three.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to tell me, Bella Wayne, Miss MacIver’s
got three false fronts!”</p>

<p>“Yes, she has. And the weeest little, teenty-weenty
trunk, she’s got. But it’s quite big enough. I could
see she hadn’t anything, hardly, to put in it. Only bottles
and fronts. After I’d begged pardon, and was
going out, I suddenly thought she must be pretty poor,
even if she did have such a lot of—do you suppose it’s
because she can’t afford hats? Well, I don’t know. Anyhow
I asked her what school she was going to after this.
She said she didn’t know. Then I looked at those nightmarey
MacIvers and asked her if she was going home.
She suddenly began to look awfuller than ever. I saw
<em>she</em> was thinking about the MacIvers, too, and it was
’most more than she could bear. So I ran back and
begged her not to go. I said I did so need her.”</p>

<p>“You needed her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to—to teach me decimal fractions.” Bella
brought out the words a little shamefaced. Then, hurriedly,
as if to forestall misapprehension: “Oh, I <em>said</em> I
knew it wasn’t much of an attraction for her—of course,
it must be perfectly horrid to have a girl like me in the
arithmetic class. But, after all”—Bella paused, and
then, with the air of a discoverer of one of the deeper
mysteries of nature—“after all, Miss MacIver <em>likes</em> hammering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
those disgusting rules into girls. What she hates
is to think there’s a girl going round without those rules
somewhere inside her. So I just told her that wherever
she was going she wouldn’t find anybody who knew as
little about fractions as I did. I was certain I told her,
perfectly certain, that she could show me all about ’em
if only she wasn’t going away. One thing was sure as a
gun—I was never going to let anybody else teach me!
She said something about that. It was the first time she
spoke, and she stood like this, with her flannel petticoat
in one hand, and a bottle in the other. But I just said:
‘Seven people have tried it already, and <em>you</em> know if
they succeeded. There’s only one person in the world
that can make me understand those disgusting rules.’
And I went quite close to her, and I said: ‘Miss MacIver,
cross my heart and hope I may die, if ever I let anybody
else <em>speak</em> to me about fractions!’ So we agreed it was
her duty to stay. But now the awful thing is I’ve <em>got</em>
to do these sickening sums! Isn’t it terrible what a lot of
trouble you can make for yourself, just all in a minute?”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you’ll stick to your part of the bargain,
Bella,” said the big girl, smiling.</p>

<p>“Got to—got to!” said the luckless one, flourishing her
pencil over the biggest of the dragons. “If I don’t she’ll
go away and starve with the rest of the MacIvers; or
drink up all those medicine bottles, and die in a wink—like
that!”</p>

<p>“Look here, shall I just see if you’re going the right
way about it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>thank</em> you,”—Bella relinquished the slate with
alacrity—“only be careful not to rub out my dragons.
They keep my mind off the MacIvers.”</p>

<p>And that was how the friendship began.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-n.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Nathaniel Mar made the mistake of
thinking that you can put off to a given
date impressing your good judgment on
those who share your life.</p>

<p>Trenn and Harry had an affection for
their father—that he without difficulty inspired—but in
their heart of hearts they were a little ashamed of their
love for him, as a species of weakness. They frankly despised
his <i lang="fr">laissez-aller</i> way of life, and looked upon him
as a warning. Their mother had seen to that.</p>

<p>The Mar boys, however, had shown business capacity
from their childhood, when instead of buying “peanut
brittle” and going to the circus, they saved up their
money to invest in hens. They made what their mother
called “a pretty penny” by selling fresh eggs to the
neighbors. The thriving young tradesmen made even
their mother pay for whatever she required, and she
“planked down the cash” without a murmur. It was a
small price for the holy satisfaction of seeing that her
children were early learning the value of money.</p>

<p>Mar got less pleasure out of his sons’ budding business
instincts. He was even obviously annoyed when he discovered
that Trenn helped Eddie Cox with his lessons,
not out of good comradeship, but at the rate of “two
bits” for each half-hour’s aid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s ugly,” said Mar, with unusual spirit. His wife
felt obliged to point out that she herself had been engaged
in very much the same occupation, when he first
met her. The “ugliness” of being paid for helping people
with their studies had not oppressed him then.</p>

<p>“You were their teacher,” said her husband.</p>

<p>“And Trenn is Eddie’s teacher while he’s teaching
him!” Then as Mar opened his lips, she quickly closed
the argument by adding, “Besides, <em>Eddie’s</em> father has
made money and Trenn’s father hasn’t. Eddie Cox will
have to buy brains all his life—he may just as well begin
now.”</p>

<p>Trenn Mar was not yet nineteen when he was so fortunate
as to have two business openings. One was to go
down to a ranch in southern California and round up
cattle for Karl Siegel, and learn all he could for Trenn
Mar. The other, to enter the employment of Messrs.
Wilks &amp; Simpson, of the Crœsus Creek Mining Company.</p>

<p>Trenn’s father meant him to take the latter—in fact
he had put himself to an uncommon amount of trouble
to get his son this opening. But Trenn was all for the
cattle business. “Besides, look at what Siegel offers.
It’s wonderful! Those men usually expect a young fellow
to buy his experience. But Siegel—”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Mar; “it looks better to start with, but
that’s not the main thing. You must look ahead.”</p>

<p>Trenn opened his brown eyes. He even grinned.
“Why yes, I mean to.”</p>

<p>“With Wilks &amp; Simpson you’ll get the hang of the
best managed placer-mining property in California.”</p>

<p>“But that whole blessed country is prospected already.
There’s no money in it for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s precisely what there is in it.”</p>

<p>Trenn looked about the room, impatient to be gone.
What did his father know about money? Less than
many a sharp boy of twelve.</p>

<p>“Sound mining knowledge,” he was saying, “will be
very useful. Not only for itself, but because it will
bring you into business contact with mining men.”</p>

<p>“What good’ll that do me?” demanded the boy, impatiently.
“<em>We</em> haven’t got any capital.”</p>

<p>“No, <em>they’ll</em> have the capital. You’ll have something
more rare.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“A great property to develop.” Then he told his son
the story of the shipwreck, and of those wonderful hours
on the farther side of Anvil Rock. Trenn sat and stared.
Mar wished he would stop it. It got on his nerves at last,
those round, brown eyes, keen, a little hard, fixed in that
wide, unwinking gaze.</p>

<p>“So that’s why I say let the cattle business go. Take
the small salary that Wilks &amp; Simpson offer, study practical
mining, and wait for your chance. In any case, by
the time Harry’s left the High School you’ll have some
valuable experience to bring into the partnership.”</p>

<p>Trenn got up and crossed the room.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the place,” said Mar, excitedly, thinking
the boy’s goal was the brown and faded reconnaissance
map. But Trenn walked straight past it to the window,
and stood looking out, to where the duck-pond used to be,
and where now a row of pretentious little pseudo-Spanish
“villas” shut out the prospect. And still he didn’t
speak.</p>

<p>“What I consider so important, is not the practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
knowledge <i lang="la">per se</i>, though I think it a very real value.
Not that so much, as the fact that through associating
yourself with that kind of enterprise you are brought
into relation with just the men you’ll need to know. If
I hadn’t gone to Rock Hill I would never have met Galbraith.
The longer I live, the more I realize it’s through
<em>people</em>—through having the right sort of human relationships,
that work is best forwarded. Here have I lived
for nearly twenty years with a secret worth millions, and
for lack of knowing the right men—”</p>

<p>“Why did you never tell Charlie Trennor?” the boy
turned round to ask.</p>

<p>“Oh, Charlie Trennor! He’s not the sort. But, as a
matter of fact, I did once mention the circumstance to
the Trennors. Many years ago. But they are men
who”—Mar stumbled—“they’ll never do anything very
big; they neither one of them have a scintilla of imagination.”
And then, in sheer excitement, speaking his
mind for once: “There never was a Trennor who had.”</p>

<p>“I expect,” said the boy, doggedly, “there’s a certain
amount of Trennor about me. I never noticed that
<em>I</em> had any imagination to speak of.”</p>

<p>Mar was conscious that his own spirit was contracting
in a creeping chill. But he said to himself it was only
because he had made the mistake of criticizing his wife
(by implication) before her son. It was right and
proper that Trenn, on such an occasion, should range
himself on the side of his mother’s family. Mar’s conception
of loyalty commonly protected him from appearing
to pass adverse judgment on the Trennors. But he
was excited and overwrought to-day. <em>He</em>, not Trenn.
All through the story, that for Mar was of such palpitating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
importance, this well-groomed youth had kept
himself so well in hand, that his father, looking at the
“correct,” cool face, had somewhat modified the presentment
of the narrative, had cut description, emotion, wonder,
and come to Hecuba as quickly as might be. And
yet now that, with as business-like an air as he could
muster, he had revealed his great secret—handed over
the long-treasured legacy—something still in the judicial
young face that gave the older man a sensation of acute
self-consciousness, made him in some inexplicable manner
feel “cheap.”</p>

<p>But he would conquer the ridiculous inclination.</p>

<p>It was for Mar an hour of tremendous significance.
He had been waiting for it for eighteen years. “After
all,” he said, making a fresh start, “you don’t need
imagination in this case. You need only to use your
eyes—”</p>

<p>Trenn lifted his, and the use he made of them was to
look at his father. Didn’t say a single word. Just
looked at the heavily-lined face a moment and then allowed
his clear, brown eyes to drop till they rested on the
toes of his own immaculate boots.</p>

<p>Hardly more than three seconds between the raising
and the lowering of the eyes. Not a sound in the room.
And yet between the meeting of that look and the losing
of it, Nathaniel Mar passed through the most painful
crisis of a life made well acquainted with pain.</p>

<p>There is a special sting in the skepticism of the young.
They should be full of faith, inclined even to credulity.
Fit task for their elders, the checking of too generous ardor.
But for the elder to detect the junior in thinking
him foolishly enthusiastic, childishly gullible—there is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in that conjuncture, something to the older mind quite
specially wounding. It passes the limit of mere personal
humiliation. It takes on the air of an affront against the
seemliness of nature. The elder has betrayed his class
and kind—has laid open to callow derision the dignity of
the riper years.</p>

<p>Mar waited. And little as he looked like it he was
praying. “Oh, my boy, believe me! Have faith that
what I say is so. And then I’ll have faith that all the
loss will be won back, through <em>you</em>, Trenn. I’ll take
heart again. It all depends on you. We’ll do great
things together, Trenn—you and I—oh, believe, believe!”</p>

<p>But Trennor Mar sat there on the narrow ledge of the
window-sill absolutely silent, with his brown eyes on his
shining boots.</p>

<p>“I was wrong,” said his father, humbly. “I have put
you off the track by using the word imagination. It has
no place here. I speak to you of fact.”</p>

<p>Trenn got up with the brisk air of one who remembers
he has business to transact, then pausing for a moment
with an eye flown already to find his hat, “I might,” he
said obligingly, “I might try to get up there some vacation,
and have a look round.”</p>

<p>He “might.” He might <em>try</em>. During some idle interval
in the real business of life. Once on the spot he
would condescend to “look round.”</p>

<p>Even his own son could not take the thing seriously.</p>

<p>Well, it began to look as if, after all, they might be
right—his wife, Charlie and Harrington Trennor, Elihu
Cox, and now Trenn. Mar, the man who believed he had
a gold mine in the arctic regions, was a sort of harmless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
monomaniac. Sitting there in a sudden darkness that
was dashed with self-derision (much was clear in those
scorching flashes), Nathaniel Mar met the grim moment
when to his own mind he first admitted doubt.</p>

<p>Groping by and by for comfort, he touched the heart
of sorrow with “Nothing like this can ever happen to me
again.”</p>

<p>It was true. In that hour something precious went
out of his life. No one, not even Trenn, had any idea
what had happened. But every one saw that Nathaniel
Mar was changed.</p>

<p class="tb">Trenn went to work on Karl Siegel’s ranch, and Harry
presently announced that he meant to join him. No, he
wasn’t going to finish at the High School. Trenn had
an opportunity to go in with Siegel on a new deal, and
Harry could be made use of, too, if he came <em>now</em>. Such
an opportunity might never repeat itself. Mrs. Mar was
of the same opinion as the boys, and Harry was in towering
good spirits.</p>

<p>His father wondered dully. Ought he not give his
younger son the same chance he’d given the elder, even
if, like Trenn, Harry should fail utterly to see how great
it was?</p>

<p>Mar shrank from a second ordeal, and yet he knew
that, vaguely enough, he had been depending on Harry’s
helping him to bear Trenn’s indifference and unbelief.
Had he not for a year now, in any lighter hour, invariably
said to himself: “After all, I have two boys. Perhaps
Harry will be the one”—yes, he must tell Harry, or
the boy might reproach him in time to come.</p>

<p>Trenn’s letter had arrived in the morning. All day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Mar revolved in his head how he would present this other
“opening” so that Harry— In the end he resolved to
take the papers out of the safe, and simply turn them
over to his son, as though the father were no longer there
to give the story tongue. Mar took the precious packet
home with him the same afternoon. Harry was out.
That evening he was late for supper, and he came in full
of the outfit he’d been buying.</p>

<p>“Buying an outfit already!” his father exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Of course! <em>I</em> don’t mean to let the grass grow—”</p>

<p>“Nor Trenn, apparently. I hadn’t heard that he was
financing you.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t. I had a little saved up, and mother gave
me the rest.”</p>

<p>Mar stared through his spectacles, and met the bright
roving eyes of the lady.</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> gave him the rest! How were you able to do
that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have a pittance in the City Bank.”</p>

<p>The rival concern. Even Hildegarde gaped with astonishment
at this revelation. Mrs. Mar had not trusted any
one to know of this nest-egg—savings out of the “house
money,” the inadequacy of which had been so often
deplored. She seemed to be torn now between regret
that its existence should have been revealed, and
pride that she had wrung it out of conditions so unpromising.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, with a spark of anger in her eye,
“and you’ll be kind enough, Nathaniel, not to break
your arm, or get yourself disabled in any way, for
there’s nothing left now for a rainy day. Unless <em>you</em>
have looked ahead as I’ve struggled to—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>He knew that she knew he had not “looked ahead” in
her sense of laying by a secret hoard, but the form of her
mandate pricked him.</p>

<p>He glanced at the desk for comfort. He had, after all,
“looked ahead” in another fashion—as Harry would see.
But—again he fell back before the check of an outfit already
bought for another purpose. And Harry was talking
all the time that he was eating—telling his mother
about his prospects and about the letter he had written
in answer to Trenn’s.</p>

<p>Already he had written! Without an hour’s hesitation,
or an instant’s consultation with his natural adviser.
Ah, no, his true “natural adviser” had obviously
been invoked, and had responded by offering him the
sinews of war. Mar, looking down into his plate, or for
occasional refreshment of the spirit into Hildegarde’s
soft, young face, was nevertheless intensely conscious of
the vivid alert personality at the other end of the table.
His wife was, as usual, not content to contemplate with
idle tranquillity the fruit of some achievement in the
past. Strange contrast to her daughter’s faculty for extreme
stillness, Mrs. Mar presented the stirring spectacle
of a person who was always “getting something done,”
and commonly getting a number of things done at once.
If it was only while the plates were being changed, she
would pull out of the yellow bag suspended at her belt, a
postcard, and with an inch length of pencil would briskly
write an order to some tradesman, or she would jump up
to straighten a picture or set the clock on three minutes,
or “catch any odd job on the fly,” as Trenn used disrespectfully
to say in private. Even on this important
and exciting occasion, she was not content merely to eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
her supper, listen to Harry’s outpouring, and throw in
shrewd responses from time to time.</p>

<p>Her handsome features wore that look of animation the
spectacle of “getting on” ever inspired in the lady, her
eyes glittered like pieces of highly polished, brown onyx,
and while she put food into her mouth with the right
hand, the left, by a common practice, executed five-finger
exercises up and down the cloth, between her plate and
the end of the table. But to-night she broke into a fantasia—the
pliant little finger curled and tossed its tip in
air, playing a soundless pæon to celebrate Harry’s entrance
into the business of life.</p>

<p>For Mar, in circumstances like these, to hold wide a
different door—had there ever been a moment less propitious?</p>

<p>“You ought to have shown me the letter before you
sent it off,” he said.</p>

<p>“I would, only I knew you’d think I ought to catch
the afternoon mail. There was barely time. And the
letter was all right—I’m sure it was. I told Trenn
either he or Siegel had got to pay me from the start. I
don’t ask much, I said, but I’m worth something if I
<em>am</em> a raw hand. I wrote the sort of letter Trenn can
show to Siegel. I piled it on about the interruption to
my studies, and about father’s preferring me to stick at
books a year or two more.”</p>

<p>“It was ingenious of you to discover that fact,” said
Mar, quietly.</p>

<p>“Oh, they mustn’t think I’m too keen, you know.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar nodded as she wound up her silent accompaniment
with a chord. But if she followed the implied
course of reasoning, not so the boy’s father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you’ve written in that vein,” said Mar, slowly,
“it seems to me still more premature to have ordered
your outfit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all O.K.,” said Harry, genially condescending
to soothe his father’s fears. “Of course I’m
<em>going</em>. Trenn’ll understand. He’s got a long head, old
Trenn has!”—and he exchanged secure smiles with his
mother—“I had to write as I did, don’t you see”—again
Harry obligingly reduced his tactics to simpler terms to
meet the slower comprehension of his father—“just to
make Siegel understand he needn’t expect to get me for
nothing. I’m not coming in on the ‘little brother
racket.’ No, sir! Old Siegel’s got to pay me something
from the start, or how can I be supposed to know it’s a
good thing? Siegel’s got to <em>show me</em>! I’m from Missouri.”
He made the boast with his pleasant boyish
laugh, pushed back his chair, and walked about, hands in
pockets, head in air, describing to his mother how fellows
often did better to take their pay in cattle, and little by
little get their own herd, and little by little get land.
Often they ended by buying out those other fellows who
started with capital. She would see! He and Trenn
weren’t going to take anything on trust. “They’ll find
they’ve got to <em>show</em> us,” he said, squaring himself before
a lot of imaginary Siegels. “We’re from Missouri!”</p>

<p>Mar, sitting silently by, rose upon that word, and tied
up the loose papers that he had laid out on his writing-table.
He returned them to the office bag, finding himself
arrived at wondering what he had better say if the
day ever came when Harry should reproach his father
for not telling him about—</p>

<p>But Mar was borrowing trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Trenn had already told him.</p>

<p>And they had laughed together. “Isn’t it just <em>like</em>
him!” Harry had said, and slapped his knee as one who
makes a shrewd observation.</p>

<p class="tb">After all there was a kind of rough justice in it. It had
been Galbraith who had made it possible for Mar to go
to Alaska. It was fitting that it should be his son who
should share in the benefits.</p>

<p>Mar spent part of the following Saturday afternoon in
drafting a letter to the son of his long dead friend. He
took uncommon pains with it and he copied it several
times. It had no need to be long, for Jack would remember
the story. He could not, of course, be expected to interrupt
those postgraduate studies, whatever they were
precisely—studies which twice already had been dropped,
as Mar supposed, while Mr. Jack went cruising about the
world in his steam-yacht. But in the nature of things the
completion of his preparation for the business of life must
be near at hand, for young Galbraith, the most energetic
and ambitious of men, was in his twenty-fourth year.
Never was such a glutton for work before. Even when he
went off pleasuring in his yacht, he went to places not renowned
for recreation, and his boon companions were
geographers and biologists and such-like gay dogs.</p>

<p>He might, at all events, without prejudice to these final
studies, begin to lay plans either for going himself to
Alaska presently, or for sending some one else. The best
course would be for him to come at once to Valdivia to
see his old friend, and to talk things over. Mar thought
it advisable to enclose in his letter a sketch of the most
interesting section of the Alaskan coast. He could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
drawn it with his eyes shut, now, but he got up, hobbled
round the desk, and took down the reconnaissance map
from between the pictures of his father and mother. At
the same moment, and while he was in the act, Mrs. Mar
came in, with that air, especially her own, of one arriving
in the nick of time to save the country. Her errand,
however, was the one Saturday afternoon invariably
brought, the conveying here of the week’s mending for
Hildegarde’s attention; the fastening of the book-rest on
the table’s edge, the propping up of some volume in the
French or German tongue, and the laying ready at one
side of a stump of lead-pencil for the marking of pregnant
passages. In front of these Mrs. Mar would establish
herself in the rocking-chair, with her knitting, or
crochet, or some other form of occupation not requiring
eyes.</p>

<p>“Hildegarde! Hildegarde!”</p>

<p>“Yes, mama,” came in through the open window from
the garden.</p>

<p>“I’m ready!” When wasn’t Mrs. Mar “ready!”
But she announced the fact with a flourish of knitting-needle,
as she rocked back and forth and scrutinized her
husband. “I’m glad,” she said, briskly, “to see you taking
down that old eye-sore.” Her eyes pecked at the
faded map. “It’s high time it was thrown away.”</p>

<p>Her husband paused in his halting progress back to
the writing-table. “Time it was thrown away?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Isn’t that what you’ve got it down for?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with it, then?”</p>

<p>Mar seemed not to hear. He turned his back on the
rocking-chair, and propped the map up in front of him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
against the mucilage pot, very much as his wife had
propped Eckermann for his regular Saturday conversation
with Gœthe.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Mar was never inclined to let her observations
go by ignored. “I can hardly suppose you want to
have it lumbering up the place here any longer.” As
still he took no notice, “It certainly isn’t decorative.”
A pause long enough for him to defend it, if he’d been
going to. “Perhaps you’ll tell me what’s the good of
keeping it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll tell me what’s the harm.”</p>

<p>She could, easily, but she forbore.</p>

<p>She only agitated the rocking-chair yet more violently,
clashed her knitting-needles as she turned the stocking in
her quick, competent hands, and with a glance at the
clock said briskly, as the door opened: “Come, come, Hildegarde.
You’re nearly three minutes behind time.”</p>

<p>The girl carried her bowl of roses over to her father’s
open window, and set it carefully down. Hildegarde was
the one person in the world Mrs. Mar never seemed to
fluster. As the girl’s eye fell on the big envelop addressed
in Mar’s bold writing, “Oh!” she said, pausing,
“have you been hearing again?”</p>

<p>“Hearing what?” came sharply from the swaying figure
on the other side of the room.</p>

<p>“You’ll read it to me after we’ve done our German,
won’t you?” whispered the girl, caressingly, as she
leaned a moment on the back of Mar’s chair.</p>

<p>“Read it to you? Why should I?” he said, nervously,
as he laid a piece of blotting-paper over his letter.</p>

<p>“You always do,” she pleaded. But if Mr. Mar imagined
that his daughter was begging to hear the letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
he himself had just written, Mrs. Mar made no such mistake.
She was well aware whose communications had
power to stir the “stolid” Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“You never told me,” the lady arraigned her husband’s
back, “that you’d been hearing again from
young Galbraith.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde, under the electric shock of the spoken
name, seemed to feel called upon to make some show of
indifference. She inspected the pile of mending with an
air of complete absorption in the extent of the damage.
Her mother was saying: “I haven’t heard anything
about that gentleman”—(oh, wealth of ironic condemnation
the accomplished speaker could throw into the innocent
words “that gentleman!”)—“not since the letter
he wrote from the barbarous place you didn’t know how
to pronounce, and couldn’t so much as find on the
map!”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you?” said her husband. “Well, you soon
may.”</p>

<p>The girl’s lowered eyelids fluttered, but the prospect of
soon hearing something on this theme left Mrs. Mar collected
enough to say: “No earthly use to darn that.”</p>

<p>“N-no,” agreed the girl.</p>

<p>“Lay a piece under. Match the stripe and cut out the
fray. There’s some like it in the ottoman.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde went and kneeled down before the big deal
“store-box.” Its lid, stuffed and neatly covered, made a
sightly receptacle for endless oddments.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar, as she clicked her needles and oscillated her
entire frame, kept her eye on the place where she was
going to dash into Eckermann the instant Hildegarde
was settled to her sewing. But true to the sacred principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of doing something while she was waiting, Mrs. Mar
thus delayed, saw it to be a timely moment to put Jack
Galbraith in his proper place. It was not the sort of
thing you could do thoroughly once, and be done with.
Like house-cleaning, it required to be seen to periodically.
“Well, what’s the <i lang="de">epoche-machende</i> news this time?”
As her husband made no haste to answer, “He’s always
‘going to break the record,’ that young gentleman! I
never knew anybody with so many big words in his
mouth.”</p>

<p>The stricture was deserved enough to gall Jack’s
friend, who moved uneasily in his revolving chair. But
he kept his eyes on the map he was drawing and he kept
his lips close shut.</p>

<p>“I see precious little result so far,” she was beginning
again.</p>

<p>“The result,” interrupted Mar, “will be judged when
he’s finished his life-work, not while he’s still preparing
for it.”</p>

<p>“Preparing! Bless me, isn’t he old enough to have
<em>done</em> something, if he was ever going to?”</p>

<p>“If he were going into business, yes. Science is a
longer story.”</p>

<p>“One excuse is as good as another, I suppose, when a
man wants to please himself. It’s like Galbraith to call
his fecklessness by a highfalutin name. ‘Science,’ ‘Investigation,’
‘Anthropology.’ Humph! But it does <em>sound</em>
better, I agree, than saying he likes satisfying a low curiosity
about savages. It isn’t even as if he wanted to
convert them. Not he! Likes them best as they are: filthy
and degraded. ‘Philology?’ Tomfoolology!”</p>

<p>It was more even than the tranquil Hildegarde could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
bear. “Hasn’t he done something wonderful about
ocean currents, papa? Didn’t you say that was the real
reason why he went that last time to—?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It was a piece of work that brought him recognition
very creditable to so young a student.”</p>

<p>“<em>Whose</em> recognition?” Not hers, the critic of the rocking-chair
seemed to say. But Mar took no notice. “And
where’s that book he was boasting about six months ago?
The one that was going to shed such valuable new light
on the—the—Jugginses of No Man’s Land. So far as I
can see by the feeble light of the female intellect, the
Jugginses still sit in the dark. Haven’t you found that
roll of seersucker yet, Hildegarde? Upon my soul!”—faster
flew the needles, harder rocked the chair—“compared
with you a snail is a cross between an acrobat and
a hurricane.”</p>

<p>The girl only laughed. “Here’s the horrid stripey
stuff, hiding at the very bottom!” She laid the roll
aside, and with a neat precision proceeded to put back all
the things she had taken out, for Hildegarde knew, if not
properly packed, the ottoman would overflow.</p>

<p>“Now, make haste,” urged her mother, “if anything
so alien is possible to you. I’m certainly not going to
read to you while you’re fussing about on the other side
of the room.” Then, not deterred in her unswerving attempt
to improve the shining hour, Mrs. Mar flung a
quick look at the bent back of her husband, and proceeded
to put in the time in clearing up one of his multitudinous
misapprehensions.</p>

<p>“What <em>I</em> can’t forgive Jack Galbraith is his ingratitude
to you.”</p>

<p>Again Mar moved a little in his creaking chair, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
halted this side speech. Hildegarde, busily repacking,
turned her blonde head toward her mother, saying: “Ingratitude!
Why, he’s perfectly devoted to papa!
That’s why I like Mr. Galbraith.”</p>

<p>“Devoted, is he? Well, he’s got odd ways of showing it.
When he was a troublesome, inquisitive little pest, he used
to reveal his devotion by coming twice every year to turn
our house upside down, and get our boys into every conceivable
mischief. Glad enough to plant himself here
then, when nobody else would be bothered with him. But
his devotion to your father doesn’t carry him the length
of coming to see him nowadays. Why, it’s fourteen years
since Jack Galbraith darkened these doors, and—”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t be surprised if he were to darken
them very soon,” said Mr. Mar.</p>

<p>“What!” said Mrs. Mar, so surprised she allowed the
rocking-chair to slow down.</p>

<p>Hildegarde stood transfixed, with the top of the ottoman
arrested, half shut.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Mar, steadily, and in complete good
faith, as he slipped the diagram into the envelop. “I’m
expecting him out here this spring.”</p>

<p>“Jack is coming!” Hildegarde said to her heart.
“Wonderful Jack is coming! Dear Jack! Dear, <em>dear</em>
Jack! Oh, the beautiful world!”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Mrs. Mar, beginning slowly to rock
again, “and what’s he coming for <em>this</em> time?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, as Hildegarde is fantastic enough to think,
he may be coming to see me,” Mar answered.</p>

<p>His wife’s laugh had a tang of shrewdness. “You’ll
find he has business of some sort to attend to in California,
if he <em>does</em> come!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just now you were complaining that he didn’t attend
to business anywhere.”</p>

<p>“My complaint—no, my regret—is, that gratitude
isn’t in the Galbraith blood.”</p>

<p>“You have no good reason for saying that.” He
spoke with uncommon emphasis.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Mar’s spirit rose to meet him. “I have the
excellent reason that I know enough about the father as
well as the son to form an opinion. I don’t forget how
your ‘greatest friend’ died, leaving you his executor and
leaving you nothing else. Not a penny piece out of all
that money.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why my friends should leave me money—”</p>

<p>“No, nor why you should get it any other way! Don’t
let me hurry you, Hildegarde, but if you’ve quite finished
mooning about in the corner there, I’d like to
mention that it’s exactly twelve and a half minutes since
I called you in to your German, and there’s the Missionary
Society at half past four, and choir practice at
seven, and before we can turn round Mrs. Cox will be
here about electing the new secretary to the Shakspere
Club, and if I’d known you were going to squander my
time like this I’d have stopped to make Harry his last
Washington pie before—”</p>

<p>“Yes, mama. Now I’m settled.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde took the seat opposite her mother and
silently applied the seersucker patch. While Mr. Mar,
behind the screen of a much-hunched shoulder, copied
with infinite care the “eye-sore” map, Mrs. Mar knitting
all the while at lightning speed, rolled out the German
uninterruptedly, till a ring at the bell was followed by
sounds of Mrs. Cox being shown into the parlor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Mar had known no one so well in Valdivia all
these years as Mrs. Elihu Cox. Mrs. Elihu was considered
“a very bright woman,” and it was no doubt so,
since even Mrs. Mar did not demur at her renown. They
met seldom, outside of church, the Shakspere Club, or the
Mission Society, yet each had admitted things to the
other that neither had admitted to any one else. Even
to-day, when there was definite business to arrange, they
talked of other matters than the vacant secretaryship.
They presented each other with views upon domestic service,
education, and husbands.</p>

<p>“I left Mr. Cox supremely happy,” said his spouse, in
that tone of humorous scorn by which many women
try to readjust the balance between the sexes. “Yes,
supremely happy, clearing out his desk. He does it
once a month. Nothing Mr. Cox does brings him so near
absolute bliss, except wandering about the place with a
hammer and nails.”</p>

<p>Both women smiled at the inveterate childishness of
the lords of creation.</p>

<p>And then, on a sudden, Mrs. Cox was grave. One
might laugh at the odd ways of men with any woman. It
is the universal bond that binds the sex together; the fine
lady feels it no less when she condoles with her washer-woman
upon a stay-at-home husband,—“Yes, yes, a man
in the house all day is dreadfully in the way,”—and
their identity of sentiment bridges the difference in fortune.
But Mrs. Mar was one with whom you might not
only laugh over the foibles of the opposite sex, you might
even be grave with her on the same ground—a rarer privilege
to the educated woman.</p>

<p>“That monthly orgy, that’s such unalloyed delight to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Mr. Cox, used to be a time of great interest to me, too,”
admitted Mrs. Cox.</p>

<p>“Really!” The president of the Valdivia Shakspere
Society could hardly believe it of her friend.</p>

<p>“Yes. You see, there’s always a great clearance made—a
general getting rid of all sorts of accumulations. I
used to watch every time when he came to the lower left-hand
drawer—” Mrs. Cox smiled faintly as one pitiful
of some long-past pain.</p>

<p>“Well, what was the matter with the lower left-hand
drawer?”</p>

<p>“That was where he kept a faded photograph of Ellie
Brezee. I used to watch to see if <em>that</em> time he was going
to throw it away. He never did.”</p>

<p>“Who was Ellie Brezee?”</p>

<p>“A sister of Colonel George Brezee—the one that died.
That was before you came to California. Mr. Cox was
engaged to Ellie when he was nineteen. But, thank goodness,
my concern about it is among the things that I’m
done with. I don’t any longer sit at home, now, with the
tail of my eye on the lower left-hand drawer while Ellie
Brezee comes out for her monthly airing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you disposed of Ellie?”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no.”</p>

<p>“He finally threw the picture away himself?”</p>

<p>“No. Only now, I know he never will.”</p>

<p>They were silent a moment. “I never <em>said</em> anything,
of course; and he never made any secret about it. I
didn’t think it any disloyalty to me that he should keep
it. At the same time”—she dropped her voice—“the
pain the sight of that faded face was to me for years—you
think it supremely silly, I suppose. But then <em>your</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
husband doesn’t hoard up the memory of some girl
that’s been dead and buried for twenty years, so you
can’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can understand,” Mrs. Mar answered, with an
eye that saw through the wall the reconnaissance map of
Norton Sound.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-j.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Jack Galbraith replied to Mr. Mar’s letter
by return of post. He apologized for not
writing more at length, but he was up to his
eyes in proof-correcting. He was seeing
through the press—(“Yes, yes, but all that
was singularly irrelevant”)—book about his experiences
(“Hum! hum!”), “extreme northern Siberia.” (“<em>Siberia</em>,
forsooth!”); no white man had ever been there before.
(“And to think he <em>might</em> have spent that time in
Alaska!”) He was “making a genuine contribution to
science”—oh, yes, quite so—“most travelers too imperfectly
equipped.” (“He couldn’t have had my letter
when he wrote this.”) The implication was, of course,
that Galbraith’s own equipment left nothing to be desired.
He even touched airily upon his claims to be considered
geographer as well as navigator, electrician, geologist,
philologist, biologist, and the Lord knows what,
beside. Yes, Jack had a large way of envisaging human
endeavor, especially his own. But certainly their letters
had crossed. Hum! he had “covered areas in science
never before exploited by a single man.” The result Mar
should presently see. For Galbraith would leave word
that a copy of the great work should be sent to his old
friend. It would be two years before he himself could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
see the thing in book form. (“What’s this?”) “Off
again, to join an expedition!” And wasn’t it strange?
He was going to the arctic as Mar was recommending.
Not precisely to Norton Bay, but (“Then he <em>had</em> got the
letter!”) “with the Swedish explorer Nordenskjöld to see
if by good luck” they could find the North Pole. And
why shouldn’t they “come home via Norton Bay?” he
asked, with irresponsible arrogance, adding, characteristically:
“I’ll mention it to the Swede. Perhaps we’ll crawl
over the crown of the world and coast down the shore of
Alaska till we come up against your Anvil Rock. If we
do, I promise to go and see after the gold-mine for you.
Thank you for saying I’m to have my share—but thank
you most of all for telling me such a mighty fine story
when I was a kid. It had a great deal to do with the
shaping of my ambition, and the direction of my multifarious
studies.”</p>

<p class="tb">And this was Galbraith’s good-by.</p>

<p>These events had taken place nearly two years before
Bella Wayne began her meteoric career at the Valdivia
School for Young Ladies.</p>

<p>If Hildegarde had recovered somewhat from her disappointment
at Jack’s failure to visit California, her
father had not ceased silently to lament, and secretly to
contemn Galbraith’s wounding flippancy in his choice of
a route to Alaska.</p>

<p>When Madeleine Smulsky’s family took her away to
live in Wyoming, Hildegarde would have been even more
desolate but for her espousal of Bella Wayne’s cause, and
consequent preoccupation with that not altogether satisfactory
protégée.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>For Miss Bella had “ways” that were distinctly rasping.
She was abominably selfish, and her big family of
brothers and sisters had spoiled her from the day she
could toddle.</p>

<p>She was, besides, the uncomfortable kind of little girl
in whose eyes you always saw reflected whatever was
amiss with you. You might have on a hat of ravishing
beauty, but if your belt had worked up and your skirt
had worked down, Bella’s glance ignored your highly
satisfactory top and fastened on your middle. Not until
after she had known Bella Wayne for some months did
Hildegarde begin to divine her own shortcomings in the
matter of dress. No gulf of years, or respect for high
standing in the school, deterred Bella from letting Miss
Mar know that she could never, never wear with success a
checked shirt-waist. Why not? Because. And for the
same excellent reason, Miss Mar must have her things
made plainer. No puffing; no shirring. “<em>I</em> can wear
‘fluffery,’ but you can’t. You’re much too like an old
goddess or Boadicea, or some whacking person like that,”
which was tepid and discreet in comparison with many
of her deliverances. She would ask you a highly inconvenient
question as soon as wink, and her own frankness
was a thing to make you cold down your back. An eye
that nothing escaped, the keenest of little noses for a secret,
a ruthless finger for any sensitive spot—that was
Bella Wayne at twelve. It was the second time that she
was being so kindly helped by Miss Hildegarde, and yet
more than at the reduction of “those disgusting fractions”
Bella looked at her new friend, bent so low over
the slate that her sole ornament, a silver locket, swung
against the dado of dragons, without whose scaly support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Bella could never hope to bring her mind down to mathematics
for a moment. She reflected that she had never
seen Miss Mar without that locket. Was there anything
inside it? Her fingers itched to open it and see. It was
suspended round the smooth neck on a narrow velvet ribbon.
Bella, supposed to be following the course of reasoning
by which it was to be demonstrated that “since
100 pounds of coal cost $0.33 per hundredweight, 385
pounds (which are equal to 3.85 times 100 pounds) will
cost 3.85 times $0.33,” she was in reality making mental
calculation of a quite different character, as she studied
the little black velvet bowknot that rested on the milk-white
nape of Miss Mar’s neck, just underneath a flaxen
ring of hair. One end of the bow was longer than the
other.</p>

<p>“Five times three are fifteen. Five and carry one—see,
Bella?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” What Bella saw, with that look of luminous
intelligence, was that the silver locket was sliding into
Miss Mar’s lap.</p>

<p>“Eight times three—oh!” But before Hildegarde
could close her fingers on the fallen trinket, Bella had
snatched it up and carried it away behind the syringas.</p>

<p>“Give me back my locket!” called Hildegarde. “Give
it back this minute!”</p>

<p>Bella made off to a remoter fastness. Hildegarde
pursued her. But Hildegarde never could catch anybody,
and Bella was already the champion runner of the
school. “Bella, I never show that to anybody. I won’t
forgive you if you open it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I <em>must</em> see why you say that!” Bella stopped
and tried the fastening. Hildegarde rushed at her, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Bella fled at each approach. At last the big girl stopped
breathless, and tried moral suasion. The little girl only
laughed, and standing just out of reach had the effrontery
to open the locket and make unseemly comment upon
what she found within.</p>

<p>“My gracious! <em>Isn’t</em> he a sweet? Where does he
live? Does he go to church? I’m sure <em>I’ve</em> never seen
this bee-yew-tiful young man before. Girls, do you want
to look at Miss Mar’s sweetheart. Come and see this darling
duck!” She summoned the laughing group that had
been looking on.</p>

<p>But Bella only pretended to show them. Every time
anybody came near, she covered the face with her thumb.
But Hildegarde, lacking the small satisfaction of knowing
that, worn out with the race and scarlet with indignation,
breathless, outraged, pursued the fleet little villain
from group to group, and after the bell rang, from
garden to hall. In vain.</p>

<p>When Bella appeared at the breaking up of school that
day, and restored the locket, Miss Mar received it in a
lofty silence, refusing even to look at a little girl so ill-mannered
and ungrateful.</p>

<p>But the next day Bella, much subdued by one of her
recurrent attacks of homesickness, red-eyed, a little
pinched-looking and woebegone, begged pardon so prettily,
that Miss Mar’s heart was melted.</p>

<p>“And I didn’t really show it to the others. Ask
anybody. I wouldn’t do <em>that</em>. Oh, no!” And then betraying
the true ground of this pious self-control, “Is it
your brother?”</p>

<p>“No.” Hildegarde bent her head over the slate.</p>

<p>“Who is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“A friend of my father’s.”</p>

<p>“Do you love him dreadfully?”</p>

<p>“Of <em>course</em> not. I never saw him.”</p>

<p>“What makes you wear his picture?”</p>

<p>“I only put it in the locket because I hadn’t anything
else the right size. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Then why did you make such a fuss when I—”</p>

<p>“Because I thought it very rude of you to look into
somebody else’s locket without permission. And it
<em>might</em> have been something that mattered.”</p>

<p>There was that in the unconverted look on the little
face which made Hildegarde hot to her ear-tips.</p>

<p>But Bella said not a word, only smiled with that returning
interest in life that so readily revives in the
breast of the shrewd observer. And without a “please”
or a “will you?” Bella handed the big girl her slate,
with its two days’ accumulation of fractions and of
dragons. Hildegarde’s sensibilities were once more so
outraged that for a moment she hesitated to accept the
task so coolly put upon her.</p>

<p>“I believe you’re a little monster,” said Miss Mar,
in her slow way. “I don’t see why I should trouble myself
about you or your arithmetic.”</p>

<p>“I know why,” returned Bella, unmoved.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because you’re the nicest of all the big girls.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde tried to conceal the fact that she was
somewhat softened by this tribute. “I’m not really the
nicest,” she said, trying to be modest.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps you’re not the nicest, but you’ve got
the longest eyelashes. It’s a good thing they aren’t as
light as your hair, isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. Fives into—”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do, you know you’d cry your eyes out if
your winkers were as nearly white as your hair is.
What do you do to make your eyelashes so long?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Now pay attention. You reduce thirty-three
and a third to thirds and—”</p>

<p>“Did your mother keep them cut when you were a
baby?”</p>

<p>“No, silly.”</p>

<p>“I believe she did.” The next day Miss Bella appeared
without eyelashes. Every individual hair snipped
close to the lid.</p>

<p>“I mean to have mine just like Miss Mar’s,” she told
the group gathered about Hildegarde’s desk. “Hers
are so immense they <em>trail</em>. I’m sure they must get
awfully in the way sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Then I wonder you run such a risk. You’d better
have left yours as they were.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if mine grow out as long as that, of course I
shall plait them and tie them up with blue ribbons.”</p>

<p>But it was not always admiration to which she treated
her patron.</p>

<p>She was once twitted quite groundlessly with feeling
herself obliged to “mind” Miss Mar.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, laughing a little wickedly. “I <em>must</em>,
you see. She’s so massive. Just look at her shoulders.
Look at her hips. Even her hair is massive. See what
wobs it goes into.” This conversation took place in the
cloak-room. “Everything about her is so big, it scares a
little person like me. Look at that hat. You’d know it
must belong to Miss Mar. If it was anybody else’s it
would be a parasol. But you can tell it’s a hat because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
it’s got an elastic instead of a stick. And just look at
the size of that elastic. Why, it’s as broad as my
garter.”</p>

<p>Now and then she would startle Hildegarde’s self-possession
by an outburst of torrential affection. And so it
came about that in spite of Bella’s blithe impertinence,
Hildegarde even in those early days thought of her with
sympathy as a lonely little being who was in reality very
grateful for a big girl’s friendship. She would follow at
Hildegarde’s heels like a pet dog, walk with her down to
the gate every day after school, and invent one ingenious
pretext after another to keep Hildegarde standing there
a moment longer. Sometimes, when at last she said
“good-by,” there was not regret alone but tears as well
in Bella’s pretty eyes.</p>

<p>“It must have been a little girl at boarding-school
that found out Friday was an unlucky day,” she announced
on one occasion. “It’s the miserablest, blackest
day of the week. Yes it is, Miss Mar. It’s just hellish.”</p>

<p>“Why, Bella Wayne! What <em>awful</em> language.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have to get hold of awful language when
you’re thinking of an awful thing. All to-night, and all
to-morrow, and all to-morrow night, and all Sunday, and
all Sunday night, to live through before I see you
again!” The small face worked with suppressed emotion,
the small mind with suppressed arithmetic. Both
eventually found outward expression. “Sixty-six
hours!” she said, while two tears rolled out of her eyes.
“Sixty-six hours till you’re back here again. I don’t
honestly think I can bear it this time. I shall die. I
know I shall. I feel very strange already. Would you
care if I died? W-would you come to the funeral?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
She choked. “W-what would you wear? You’d look
p-perfectly bee-yew-tiful in black. <em>Do</em> wear black. Oh,
I <em>wish</em> I was dead. It would be so nice to see how you
look in black.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde was touched to find how wildly delighted
the homesick little girl was at the idea of being invited to
spend Saturday afternoon at the Mars—a little anxious,
too, was Miss Mar, lest the occasion should not come up
to such ecstatic expectation. Not that the Mar house
was at all the forlorn and dingy place it had been in the
days when Mrs. Mar struggled alone, with a scant income
and three babies. The general impression was that the
Mar boys already contributed generously to the family
resources. But the fact was that their mother was ingeniously
making the very most of what “the boys”
added to the common purse. The amount was as yet
quite trifling—“of necessity,” she would have added,
for they were both young men who looked ahead. But it
was really to Hildegarde that the little house owed its
air of immaculate freshness and good taste. If she
couldn’t play or sing, she could paint—bookshelves, the
floors, even the woodwork. Several years ago she proved
that she could paper a room. She managed to cover the
old furniture with charming chintz “for a song,” and
she made curtains out of nothing at all. No one could
arrange flowers better or grow them half so well. When
she was given money for her clothes, she often spent it on
something for the house. Not fully realizing her genius
for domestic affairs, she told herself the reason she did all
this was to make the house pretty “for when Jack comes
back.” He might arrive quite suddenly. He did everything
without warning. I may come home from school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
any day to find him here! Oh, it lent a wonderful zest
to life to remember that.</p>

<p>Bella was pleased to like Miss Mar’s garden immensely,
but even more she liked Miss Mar’s room, with its white
curtains and dimity-covered toilet-table, and the scant
and simple furniture that looked so nice and fresh since
Hildegarde had herself enameled it. When the little
visitor looked round with that quick-glancing admiration
and said: “Oh, it’s much prettier than mine at
home.”</p>

<p>“What’s yours like?” asked Miss Mar, politely.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all pink silk, and I’m sick of it. What
made you think of having everything white?”</p>

<p>“This, I believe,” said her hostess, nodding at the
climbing white rose that looked in at the window. “But
it’s partly that I like things that wash and that don’t
fade.”</p>

<p>“Well, I simply love your house. I’d no <em>idea</em> it would
be like this.”</p>

<p>“Why, what did you think it would be like?”</p>

<p>“Oh—a—kind of—no, I shan’t say. You’d misunderstand.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde felt it prudent not to insist. If you did,
with this young person, you were exposed to the most
mortifying results.</p>

<p>“Who are these?” Bella demanded, inspecting the
pictures.</p>

<p>“My brothers. That’s Trenn and this is Harry.”</p>

<p>“Will they be at tea?”</p>

<p>“No, they’re on a ranch in Tulare County.”</p>

<p>“Why, <em>we’ve</em> got a ranch in Tulare County.” She
was still looking round as if expecting to find something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
that as yet escaped her eye. “Where’s—where—a—Show
me your—your ribbons and things.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got any. We can’t afford ribbons in this
family.”</p>

<p>“Let me see your collars and ties, then.” Hildegarde
opened her top drawer. In the course of turning over
collars and handkerchiefs and little boxes the silver
locket came to light.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you wear it any more?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Bella leaned her head with its halo of short, brown
curls against her friend, and very softly she beguiled
her: “Please, Miss Mar, show me that friend of your
father’s again.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde hesitated a moment and then she opened
the locket. Jack Galbraith’s face smiled out upon the
big girl and the little girl.</p>

<p>“Did you say you hadn’t ever seen him?”</p>

<p>“No, he hasn’t been here for sixteen years. Not since
he was a little boy. And he might have been here always,
because he was an orphan and his father was my
father’s greatest friend. But some relations of his that
nobody had ever heard of before, they discovered him
when he was nine, and made him come to New York and
live with them. But he didn’t like it. At least—<em>I</em> don’t
know—mother thinks <em>they</em> didn’t like it.”</p>

<p>“Why does she think that?”</p>

<p>“Because they let him go away to school. And he
spent his vacations canoeing, climbing mountains, and
doing all sorts of queer things rather than live with his
relations. Then he went to Harvard, and then he went
abroad and studied. He’s always studying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gracious! what makes him do that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he wants to find out about everything. And
he’s doing it. He’s written a book with things in it nobody
ever heard of before. Father says it’s a work of
genius. Mr. Galbraith was coming here two years ago,
when he’d finished the book, only just then—”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think,” Bella interrupted with a sigh, “I
didn’t think from his picture he was so awful old.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t. He’s barely twenty-five.”</p>

<p>But Bella shook her head. “If a person’s over twenty
he might just as well be a hundred.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ordinary people. But it doesn’t matter <em>how</em>
old a genius is. Father’s awfully excited about Mr.
Galbraith just now, for he’s been away a year and a
half on an arctic expedition and we’re expecting him
back next summer. We may be hearing from him any
day after the middle of June. Father and I often talk
about it when we’re alone together.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you talk about it when there’s anybody
there?”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother’s always so down on Mr. Galbraith.”</p>

<p>“What’s she down on him for?”</p>

<p>“Just because he wants to discover the North Pole.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you think yourself that’s rather—”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“To be wasting two whole years in just hunting round
for the Pole? What’s the good of the Pole, anyway?”</p>

<p>Hildegarde smiled a smile of superiority.</p>

<p>“My geography”—Bella invoked authority that even
a big girl must respect—“my geography says—”</p>

<p>“You’re too young to understand. It’s not the
Pole. It’s the glory.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“What glory?”</p>

<p>“Nobody’s ever yet got there.”</p>

<p>“Why should anybody? Lots of nicer places.”</p>

<p>“A great many people have tried. A good many have
died trying—”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a good reason for not bothering about
it any more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re just like—” But filial respect restrained
Miss Mar. “I agree with Mr. Galbraith. He
thinks there’s nothing in the world half so interesting
to do.”</p>

<p>“He <em>must</em> be silly.”</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t! He’s splendid—” But Hildegarde
snapped the locket to, and hid it under her best handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>The following Saturday, when Bella asked again to
see the locket, Miss Mar declined to bring it out. Bella
begged in vain. She discovered that her big, gentle
friend could be immovable.</p>

<p>To Hildegarde’s dismay, Bella presently dissolved in
tears. “Then may I s-see the work of g-genius?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you may look at his book all you like.” She
even let Bella take it away with her to tide her over
Sunday. But Mr. Galbraith’s “Winter among the
Samoyedes” had small success with Miss Wayne. “They
make me sick, those people! I can’t think how anybody
likes hearing about their dirty ways,” and she even cast
reflections on Jack for wasting his time over such “horrors.”
However, there was another side to it. “What a
relief it’ll be to him to be with <em>us</em> after the Samoyedes!”</p>

<p>“With <em>us</em>!” Hildegarde smiled inwardly.</p>

<p>Sitting by the rose-framed window one Saturday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
afternoon, talking as usual about Mr. Galbraith and how
soon he might be expected back from the Pole, Bella suddenly
burst out: “I’m tired to death of saying ‘Miss
Mar.’ I <em>do</em> wish you’d let me call you ‘Hildegarde.’”</p>

<p>The big girl’s breath was taken away. For the gulf
between twelve and sixteen is a thing hardly passable in
that stronghold of class distinction, a girls’ school. It
was rare, indeed, that one of Miss Mar’s ripe age stooped
to help a little girl over a difficulty in her lessons. It
required something of the missionary spirit to take such
pity upon homesickness, as occasionally to give the
afflicted one the great treat of visiting a big girl on
Saturday afternoon—but really to go to the length
proposed—</p>

<p>“I shan’t believe you really love me,” the little girl
rushed on, “unless you say yes. Oh, do say yes. <em>Everything</em>
depends on it. I’ll promise always to say ‘Miss
Mar’ before people. But if you’ll let me call you Hildegarde
when we’re alone, I’ll <em>know</em> you’re my best
friend. And then I’ll tell you a secret. I’ll tell you
two. <em>Tremendous</em> secrets!”</p>

<p>It was finally arranged.</p>

<p>“Now for the tremendous secrets,” said Hildegarde,
smiling.</p>

<p>But Bella was portentously grave, even agitated.
“Well,” she said, bracing herself, “my father’s an
Englishman. Don’t tell anybody. Cross your heart and
hope you may die if ever you tell the girls.”</p>

<p>“All right. Cross my heart and hope I may die. But
how in the world—?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t my fault, you see. And <em>I’m</em> an American
all right. I’ve always wanted to explain to you ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
since you were so angelic about my fractions; it’s because
my father’s an Englishman I have to eat milk
pudding. Over there”—Bella flicked a small hand across
the American continent and over the Atlantic deep, to
indicate an inconsiderable island where the natives persist
in strange customs—“over there they all do it. Of
course, the minute I’m of age I shall insist on pie.”
They discussed the matter in all its bearings.</p>

<p>“Now about the other secret.”</p>

<p>“Well”—even the daring Bella caught her breath and
paused. “No, not to-day. I’ll keep the tremendousest
one for another time. But <em>do</em> get out the silver locket,
<em>dear</em> Hildegarde, and let’s look at it.”</p>

<p>Ultimately she prevailed. The next time Bella came
she found a delightful surprise. The low table was
cleared of everything but bowls of roses; and against the
white wall great ferns printed plain their tall and splendid
plumes—leaving free a little space in the middle
where, on a gilt nail, hung the open locket.</p>

<p>Bella was delighted with the whole scheme. “It only
wants one thing to make it perfect. No, I won’t tell you
what it is. I’ll bring it next Saturday.”</p>

<p>“It” proved to be a paper of Chinese joss-sticks, and a
little bronze perforated holder. “We must each burn
one to him every week,” she said, setting up her contribution
below the dangling locket.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know if we ought,” Hildegarde said.
“Joss-sticks are prayers you know—at least the Chinese
think so.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course they’re prayers. That’s why I
brought them.”</p>

<p>While the two joss-sticks sent up into the rose-perfumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
air faint spirals of an alien fragrance, the two
girls sat in front of the confident young face looking out
of the silver locket, and talked endlessly about the owner.</p>

<p>Hildegarde found it subtly intoxicating to have so keen
an auditor—a sharer even (to the humble extent possible
for extreme youth) in the great pivotal romance of existence.</p>

<p>And then Bella had such wonderful inspirations. It
was she who saw the larger fitness in Mr. Mar’s habit of
going fishing on Saturday afternoons. What was that
but an arrangement of the gods that he should be so
effectually out of the way, that Hildegarde might with
safety borrow from his desk the Galbraith letters. Sitting
close together on a square of Japanese matting, in front
of the rose table, an anxious ear listening for Mrs. Mar’s
return from the missionary meeting, the dark head leaned
against the fair, while the two girls read and re-read
those precious documents, in an atmosphere charged with
incense and a palpitating joy. One day, arrived regretfully
at the end of the letter they liked best, Bella bent
and kissed the signature. Hildegarde’s heart gave a
great jump. The daring of that deed was well-nigh impious.
Hildegarde, when all by herself, had done the
same, but that was different.</p>

<p>“Now you know my other secret,” said Bella, very
pink—“the tremendousest one of all.” When the first
shock had died away, Hildegarde was left with a pitiful
tenderness before the disarming frankness of such a confession.
Poor little Bella! Why, Jack didn’t even know
of her existence. He never would, till in some rare idle
hour of the glorious future, Hildegarde should tell him
of a little homesick girl she had befriended once at school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>But Bella could be depended on to break in upon such
gracious forecasting of the future, with a suddenness that
made the picture dance, “Which of us two do you suppose
Jack’ll fall in love with?”</p>

<p>Hildegarde, almost paralyzed by the presumption this
implied, barely managed to bring out, “You’re much too
little to think of—”</p>

<p>“I shan’t be little always.”</p>

<p>“You’ll always be more than twelve years younger
than Mr. Galbraith.” Hildegarde always said Mr. Galbraith
when she wanted to keep the intruder at a distance.</p>

<p>But Bella advanced as bold as brass. “<em>Anyhow</em> I think
he’ll fall in love with me.”</p>

<p>“Of course a person so modest would be likely to appeal
to any gentleman.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s not my being modest he’ll mind about. It’s
other things.”</p>

<p>“What other things?”</p>

<p>“Well—you—of course you’ve got your eyelashes,
and you’re in the full bloom of womanhood. But <em>I’m</em>
in the first blush of youth. I think he’ll like that best.”</p>

<p class="caption">“The two girls sat in front of the confident young face looking
out of the silver locket”</p>
</div>

<p>It was the second Saturday in June, and school was
breaking up next week. Mrs. Mar had finished off the
Braut von Messina in the dining-room, and barely begun
with the Hindu Mission on the other side of the city.
Hildegarde had retired to her room to watch, not for
Bella’s coming (the window did not command the front),
but for Mr. Mar’s going down the garden with rod and
creel. What made him so dilatory to-day? While Hildegarde
wondered, Bella came flying in, shut the door
with agitated care, faced about with cheeks of crimson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
hat over one ear and the whisper, “Hildegarde, I’ve
seen him! I’ve seen him! Oh, Hildegarde, he’s here!”
Wherewith she precipitated herself upon her friend’s
neck and hugged her breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Who, who?”</p>

<p>“Why, ‘he.’ <em>He’s</em> here! The only man I ever loved!”</p>

<p>Hildegarde took the dancing dervish by the shoulders.
“You don’t mean—”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I do. He came in just before me. He’s
perfectly glorious. Just to look at him makes you feel—makes
you think you’ve got windmills shut up inside
you. Everything goes whirling round. And when he
asked” (Bella lowered her pipe to a masculine depth):
“‘Is Mr. Mar at home?’ it sounded so beautiful, I thought
for a moment he was talking poetry. Oh, Hildegarde!
<em>Hildegarde!</em>” Again she sunk her ecstacy to whispering
as she followed her friend out into the hall. Together
they hung over the banisters. The visitor was talking
more poetry apparently in the dining-room. The two
girls stayed suspended there an eternity. At last with
thumping hearts, upon Bella’s suggestion, they went
down into the entry. “We’ll pretend to be putting on
our overshoes. I’ll have Mrs. Mar’s!” whispered
Bella, excitedly, ignoring the fact that the continued fine
weather and dusty streets lent an air of eccentricity to
the proceeding. She stopped after drawing on one big
overshoe and shuffled softly to the dining-room door. She
put her eye to the keyhole. No use. Notwithstanding
Hildegarde’s whispered remonstrance, she glued her ear
to the aperture. The door was suddenly opened and Miss
Bella fell sideways into the arms of an astonished young
man, who said: “Hello, what’s this?” Hildegarde,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
drowned in sympathetic confusion, helped Bella to regain
her equilibrium, while she muttered the explanation
“Overshoes!”</p>

<p>“This is my daughter Hildegarde, Mr. Cheviot,”
said Mr. Mar, “and this is our little friend, Bella
Wayne.”</p>

<p>“<em>Ch-Cheviot!</em>” stuttered the little friend.</p>

<p>The young man with the laughing eyes said: “Anything
wrong with the name?” and having shaken hands
with “my daughter Hildegarde,” he departed.</p>

<p>“Did you say his name was Cheviot?” Hildegarde
asked her father.</p>

<p>“Yes. The new recruit at the bank. Seems to be an
intelligent sort of fellow.”</p>

<p class="tb">With ease and celerity Miss Bella transferred her affections
from a faded photograph, a packet of letters, and a
book of travels, to a real live young man with a square
jaw that looked as if he meant business, but with a ready
laugh, too, as if the business were not without its diverting
aspect. Then he had rough brown hair that “fitted”
him. Bella would have told you this was a rarity, most
people’s beginning too far back from the forehead, or
growing too much away from the ears, leaving them
with a bare and naked look. Or it grew in a peak. Or it
didn’t grow low enough on the neck and was like a
badly made wig, that had slipped forward. Or worse
than anything, it forgot where to stop and grew down
into the collar like Professor Altberg’s, prompting the irreverent
Bella to whisper to her neighbor (while the
grave instructor was sitting with head bent over a Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
exercise): “How far do you think it goes? Do you suppose
he’s hairy <em>all</em> down his back?”</p>

<p>However that might be, Cheviot’s hair fitted him.
Moreover, he had, in Bella’s estimation, a fascinating, if
somewhat mocking air toward little girls, and he helped
one little girl gallantly through the dismal Sundays by
the simple process of sitting in church where she could
watch him. Once in a while in coming out, Bella would
catch his eye, and he would laugh and give her a nod.
On the rare occasions of his encountering Miss Bella at
the Mars’, he never failed to stop and mimic her first
greeting, “I’m ‘Ch-Cheviot,’ you know. Now what’s
the matter with that name?” which was vastly entertaining,
not to say “taking.”</p>

<p class="tb">John Galbraith came back to America that autumn,
but he stayed in the East.</p>

<p>Bella didn’t much care what he did now, for she was
thirteen, and in spite of the ugliness of their Hindu
protégée Miss Wayne had joined the Busy Bees. That
was because Hildegarde had told her that Louis Cheviot
went to their dances. Bella saw at once the fitness of her
doing the same. The result was that she seldom waltzed
less than twice with the new hero, who, it must be admitted,
was a better batsman than dancer. But nobody
could help “getting through” with Bella as a partner,
for she danced divinely. Cheviot should have been better
pleased to get her for his partner, but it was plain that
he was unduly preoccupied about “my daughter Hildegarde.”
Several of the young men were. Bella told herself
with a consciousness of native worth, that she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
never minded in the least before. But this was different.
She made up her mind that if “Ch-Cheviot” goaded her
much further by this display of misplaced devotion, she
would just take the misguided young man aside some
day and talk to him “as a friend.”</p>

<p>She would tell him about Jack Galbraith.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-b.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Bella Wayne’s father had been in the
royal navy. His health had given way
about the same time as his patience on the
vexed question of non-promotion. He retired
from the service, went with his
American wife and family to California on a visit,
became enamoured of the climate, bought a place, and
settled there. The three youngest of his seven children
were born in Tulare County, but for him “home” was
still England, however ungrateful. They all went back
every second year to visit his father in Staffordshire, and
when Bella’s two sisters found English husbands, there
were three reasons for the recurrent visit to the old
country. The eldest son, Tom Wayne, had made a
fortune on the New York Stock Exchange and married
a girl belonging to one of the old Knickerbocker families.
Tom’s country house on Staten Island proved highly
convenient as a half-way station between England and
California. Mrs. Tom was a very charming person, and
a certain portion of Bella’s satisfaction in going abroad
lay in the chance it presented of making a visit to Staten
Island, on the way over and back. Nevertheless, as she
never failed to tell Hildegarde on her return, there was
no place to be compared to California, no friend and no
“in-law” who could make up to her for being away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Hildegarde, and she might have added, from the neighborhood
of that obdurate creature with the cold blue
eyes and the colder heart, Louis Cheviot. Those who
thought about it at all were surprised that the friendship
of the two girls was not more interrupted upon Hildegarde’s
graduating from the school, when Bella was less
than fifteen. But not upon community of tasks, rather
upon something essential in the nature of each had their
alliance been founded—kept vital by wants in each that
the other could supply, excesses in each that the other
helped to modify. They themselves thought their relation
had its deeper roots in a conviction of the peculiar
sanctity of girls’ friendships; a creed to which Hildegarde’s
fidelity effected Miss Bella’s actual adhesion only
by degrees and with notable backslidings.</p>

<p>But even in early days, Bella felt it was highly distinguished
to stand in this relation to one who thought and
talked about it as Hildegarde did. Hadn’t she said in
that soft, deliberate way of hers, that it was capable of
being one of the most beautiful things in all the beautiful
world? It was something, she said, no man knew anything
about. Why, they presumed to doubt its possibility
even! Ah, they should have known Hildegarde Mar and
Bella Wayne. Men believed that all girls were, at heart,
jealous of all other girls. They thought meanly of the
sex. They pointed to David and Jonathan, to Orestes
and Pylades, to instances innumerable of men’s faithfulness
to men. But what bard or legend celebrates
woman’s friendship as toward woman? Well, you see,
all the chroniclers since the beginning of the world have
been of the scoffer’s sex. That was why women’s friendships
had never been celebrated—though men said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
real reason was—oh, they spoke blasphemies!—and they
hadn’t known Hildegarde and Bella. It was Hildegarde’s
theme, but Bella agreed to every word. Yes,
yes, <em>their</em> friendship would show the world!</p>

<p>For qualities alien to her own, Hildegarde came to look
upon her little friend with an adoring admiration.
Bella’s wit and Bella’s originality, Bella’s entire “mode
of being,” were at once tonic and delight. Then, too, behind
her provoking charm was a finished daintiness,
which with her became elevated into a special quality,
distinctive, all-pervading, a certain strangeness of
fragility—a physical fineness like the peculiar fineness of
a flower—a something suggesting evanescence, and having
the subtle pathos of the thing that may not, cannot
bide.</p>

<p>It would have been hard to say which was of most use
to the other in making clearer the riddle of life, or more
radiant the beauty of the world, or more wonder-waking,
the mystery of a young girl’s heart. They read, and
walked, and talked, and worked, together, paying their
vaunted friendship a finer tribute than words, however
honestly uttered; for they grew in each other’s company.</p>

<p>The younger, too, was cured of certain of her more inadmissible
“ways,” while the elder learned from Butterfly
Bella many a thing besides the art of making the most
of her beauty.</p>

<p>Not that Hildegarde despised this last. She had none
of the comfort of knowing it was part of her largeness of
nature, that she should take more easily to beautifying
her home than to making the best of herself. Indeed to
the end of time, she required guidance in matters of
dress. And who so well qualified as Miss Bella to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
advice. She went further: with her own ingenious little
hands she made the most becoming of “shirt-waists,”
trimmed heavenly hats, and firmly forbade fripperies.</p>

<p>“No, no, they’re not for the massive.” She applauded
her friend for not wearing trinkets—she didn’t like to
see her even with her maternal grandmother’s emerald
brooch. “No, I don’t like you in ‘didoes’ of any sort.
They’re too insignificant for you. You ought to wear
ropes of pearls, or a tiara of diamonds, or better still,
something barbaric—what’s one little lady-like emerald
set in a filigree of diamond chips? Why, it can’t even be
seen—on you. Of course the emerald’s a pretty little
stone, and the old setting’s nice. It would shine out on
me, but—well, it’s simply <em>lost</em>, you know, on your heroic
neck.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde deplored her size, she carried it even with
a sense of humiliation just as she bore with her lack of
elegant accomplishments. It was pretty terrible to have
to put up with being such a great lump—especially with
the ethereal Bella always by to point the advantage of
the opposite. Still, there was no blinking the facts.
“You’re right, I believe, didoes of any sort <em>are</em> rather
wasted on me,” Hildegarde would say meekly, “I must
have felt that when I hardly ever wore them—though I
liked them. It takes you, Bella, to explain things.”</p>

<p>Nothing was ever allowed to come in the way of their
spending their Saturday afternoons together, and if, as
time went on, less was heard about Jack from Hildegarde,
it was only because so very much more was heard about
Cheviot from Bella.</p>

<p>It was a difficult moment when two girls with such
lofty ideas of friendship met for the first time after Cheviot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
had said to Hildegarde at a dance: “When are you
going to begin to care for me?” She had been so taken
by surprise that she had only smiled and said: “I don’t
know,” but she thought hardly less of Bella at the moment
than she thought of Jack. So the next time that
Bella remarked by the way: “Isn’t he perfectly fascinating?”
Hildegarde had hesitated, and she—yes—she
was actually getting red. Bella stared, “Why, are <em>you</em>
coming to—to—”</p>

<p>“No; <em>oh</em>, no! Only—”</p>

<p>“Only what?”</p>

<p>“It’s dreadfully hard, but I haven’t forgotten our
compact. So I suppose I’ve got to tell you what—what
he said to me last night.”</p>

<p>Bella received the information with a half-hysterical
pretense of carrying it off gaily. “Well, what’s there
new in that? As if every soul in Valdivia hasn’t known
for perfect ages that he cares about you frightfully. I
don’t mind <em>you</em>. Because you’re Hildegarde, and any
man who didn’t love you must—well, there must be
something pretty wrong about him. I shall give him a
whole year—maybe even two, to go on like that, and then
when I’m sixteen, or seventeen at the latest, I won’t have
it any longer.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde, enormously relieved, laughed and kissed
her. “Oh, you nice, funny child!”</p>

<p>“Only promise me again, cross your heart and hope
you may die, if you ever keep anything from me about
Louis Cheviot.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde complied and life went on as before—only
that Hildegarde showed herself less ready to fall in with
Bella’s ecstasies. An instinct to forestall a possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
jealousy made her cavil from time to time. “Don’t you
think his shoulders are too broad for his height?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t, and look how splendidly he carries them.
You have to see him beside a huge man, like Mr. Mar,
before you realize—”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; <em>that’s</em> true,” Hildegarde hastened to heal
the wound.</p>

<p>“And, anyhow, I don’t think it’s kind of you to run
Louis down. I am always very nice about Jack.”</p>

<p>The end of it was that Cheviot came more and more to
the Mar house, and seemed so diverted when he found the
lively Bella there, that Hildegarde gave herself up without
reserve to the three-cornered friendship.</p>

<p>He took the girls boating and organized parties to the
Tule Lands, and was altogether a most invaluable ally in
the agreeable pursuit of being a young lady in her first
season.</p>

<p>Still, when Bella praised him absolutely without
moderation, “Y-yes,” Hildegarde would respond, “he is
<em>nice</em>, only—”</p>

<p>“Only what?” says Miss Bella, instantly on the defensive.</p>

<p>“Well, you know I prefer big men.”</p>

<p>“Of course you do. It’s being so massive yourself.
But he’s exactly the right size for me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, and he’s quite the nicest of all the Valdivia
boys.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s going pretty far,” says Bella, with an
edge in her voice.</p>

<p>Then the other, with that recurrent though only half-conscious
need to show that after all, she, Hildegarde,
wasn’t dazzled—not being in Bella’s state, <em>she</em> could see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
blemishes—the older girl would add: “And yet somehow
for all his niceness, and making us always have a good
time when he’s there, to my thinking there’s something
terribly unromantic about Louis Cheviot.”</p>

<p>“Now you only say that,” retorts Miss Bella, with
sparkling eyes, “because he’s in a bank.”</p>

<p>“No—no,” vaguely, “but I don’t believe he’s got any
soul.”</p>

<p>“Just because he isn’t hunting the North Pole!”</p>

<p>“No. That isn’t the reason. I assure you it isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Then it <em>can</em> only be because he likes to laugh at
everything.”</p>

<p>“He <em>is</em> pretty frivolous,” said Hildegarde, “and he
ridicules friendship. But no, it’s not that, either. It’s
because he’s kind of chilling. To <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p>“Chilling to you?” Bella beamed. “Oh, do tell me
about that.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes he’s positively rude.”</p>

<p>“To <em>you</em>?” Bella could have danced.</p>

<p>“To anybody.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but <em>when</em> was he positively rude to you? How
black-hearted of you, Hildegarde, not to tell me that before!
You might have known I’d simply <em>love</em> hearing
about that.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde laughed. “Why, I haven’t seen you since
Thursday.”</p>

<p>“Was it at your birthday party?”</p>

<p>“Yes, at the birthday party.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, how did he do it? What did he say?”</p>

<p>“It was after we’d all been reading the poem that
came with Eddie Cox’s present. Louis made fun of it.”</p>

<p>“That was only being rude to Eddie.” Bella’s face fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait till you hear. I defended it, of course, and
said: ‘It isn’t as easy as it looks to make birthday odes.’
‘It certainly doesn’t <em>look</em> difficult—to make <em>that</em> kind,’
he said. ‘Then why,’ I said, just to stand up for Eddie,
‘why have you never written a poem about my airy
tread?’ And Louis said: ‘Well, there may be another
reason, but no girl who stands five foot ten in her stockings
and weighs a hundred and fifty pounds need ask it.’
<em>That’s</em> the kind of thing.”</p>

<p>It was an incident Miss Bella loved to recall. No man
could be really in love with a girl he had said <em>that</em> to.</p>

<p>But some months later, Hildegarde was obliged, according
to the code, to report that Cheviot had been
“going on” again.</p>

<p>Bella insisted on having all the “horrid details.”</p>

<p>“It was last night at the taffy pulling. You know how
we’d all been laughing at his stories of Miss Monk meeting
the Carters’ black cow—”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was laughing so I couldn’t stop, and it was
so warm in that room the candy was melting. You remember
he said—”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Bella, with feeling, “<em>I</em> remember. He
said you must come and pull with him.”</p>

<p>“—out in the porch where the candy and I would cool
off.”</p>

<p>“And you went.”</p>

<p>“And he made more jokes on the way out. I begged
him not to talk any more, for I’d got into a silly mood
and everything he said made me laugh. ‘I know, I
know,’ he said. ‘I labor under the fatal disadvantage of
the funny man, but I could make you serious you know.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
And then—then—he had the impertinence—to kiss
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hildegarde!”</p>

<p>“Yes. It was dreadfully grotesque, too—our hands
were stuck together by that great yellow rope of taffy,
and I could only stammer and get redder. But I did say
I was not going to forgive him. Nobody had ever been
so rude to me before. Then he got awfully serious and
said all kinds of things—”</p>

<p>“<em>What</em> kind?”</p>

<p>“And at last he asked me what was wrong with
Ch-Cheviot—your old joke, you know.”</p>

<p>Bella clenched her hands. Sacrilege! to present <em>her</em>
joke to another girl! She had always imagined that
would be just how he would propose to her. He would say:
“Bella, my beautiful, what’s the matter with Ch-Cheviot?”</p>

<p>“Well, go on.”</p>

<p>“If I didn’t like him enough he said, what sort of man
<em>was</em> I going to like? And I thought it only fair to give
him some idea, so I tried to soften it by laughing a little—I’d
forgiven him by then, you know, for he’d said
<em>such</em> things—”</p>

<p>“What things?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sorry kind of things, and he looked so—so—well,
I’d forgiven him. But I told him plainly that if it ever
is a question of the sort of man I am to care for, it won’t
be some one who is just nice and makes me have a good
time. It will be some great, gloomy creature who makes
me cry—and lifts me to the stars. I was laughing, but I
meant it—and I said: ‘I’d worship <em>that</em> kind of man.’”</p>

<p>“What did he say then?”</p>

<p>“Well, he looked sort of down I thought, so I said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
‘You wouldn’t let me worship you, even if I could.’
‘I’d let you love me,’ he said.”</p>

<p>“Oh-h. What else?”</p>

<p>“We went in after that.”</p>

<p>“And he was just as funny as ever,” said Bella,
clutching at frail comfort.</p>

<p>“Oh, quite,” agreed Hildegarde.</p>

<p>It was small consolation to Miss Bella that Cheviot was
singular in his obduracy. Before she was eighteen she
was uncommonly well accustomed to seeing the stoutest
masculine defenses go down before her. The two Mar
boys had long been her devoted slaves. And Bella had
flirted with both of them impartially, taking what she felt
was only a becoming share in the interest all Valdivia
felt in those go-ahead young men, whenever they came
home for a visit. They were pointed to as models. Look
how they “got on”—they did it visibly—while you
looked they seemed to have to restrain themselves from
rising out of your sight. They kept Miss Bella supplied
with candy and flowers and they corresponded with her
when she went abroad. Secretly dreading the fascinations
of the Britisher, they asked in scoffing postscripts
how the effete nations were getting on. Bella’s view of
all this was that, provided the young men were “nice,”
a girl could hardly have too many of them contending
for her favor. It was what they were there for. Each
time she came home, she brought the Mar boys a scarf-pin
apiece, and pleased them still more by invariably demanding
a cent in return. “I can’t <em>give</em> you a thing
with a point. Something dreadful would happen! you
must buy them.” That looked, they felt, as if she were
“taking it seriously”—but which was she taking?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The year that Bella was eighteen, after a summer in
England, she arrived at Staten Island just in time to
celebrate her birthday. She was full of joy at getting
back.</p>

<p>The conscious approval that she bestowed on the
greater splendor of the American autumn had been generously
extended to the profusion of fine fruit that greets
one here at breakfast, to the individual bathrooms, even
to the spacious, drawered, behooked, and shelved clothes-closets
so agreeably numerous in the American house.
The same satisfaction with which she had noted these
things consciously revisited her as she trod the wide,
shallow steps of the staircase, that in its descent halted
leisurely upon two broad landings, having each a large
unglazed window opening upon the hall below. The observant
young eyes paid a flitting tribute to the beautiful
woodwork of the balusters and the great tall doors of the
rooms she passed, deciding as she went, there’s nothing
nicer than a new American house, unless it’s an old
(and a very old) English one. Even then, to <em>live</em> in,
give her the American.</p>

<p>Like so many of the first generation born in “the
States,” this child of an old-world father was more
American in tastes and spirit than any daughter of the
Revolution. But, partly as a matter of physical inheritance,
partly, perhaps, because of her frequent visits
to England, she bore about her still a good deal of the
peculiar stamp of a certain type of English girl. As she
came trailing slowly down the wide staircase of Tom
Wayne’s country house on Staten Island, the practised
eye would have little difficulty in detecting a difference
between the figure on the stair and the typical “American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
beauty,” a something less sumptuous and more distinguished.
Her head held not quite so high, and yet in
her carriage something indefinably more aloof. The
longer waist, not quite so ruthlessly stayed and belted,
giving an effect of greater ease; the longer neck, the
shoulders a little more sloping, the eyes less eager and
yet with more vision in them—something in the whole,
gracious as the aspect was, a little reluctant and more
than a little elusive. The Paquin gown Bella had brought
back and wore to-night for the first time, was long, and
straight, and plainer than prescribed by the New York
fashion of the moment—a gauze, discreetly iridescent,
showing over a white satin petticoat shifting lights of
pink, and pearl, and silver, a gown that shimmered as
the wearer walked, and clothed her in glancing light and
soft-hued shadows.</p>

<p>Bella knew that she was very early, and she came
down slowly, drawing a long glove up her slim, bare
arm. When she reached the square window on the
lower landing, she stopped, laid the other glove on the
sill, and proceeded to button the one she had on. A
slight noise in the hall below made her lean her arms on
the broad, polished sill of the opening, and look down.</p>

<p>A man stood by a table facing her, but with eyes bent
upon the books he was turning over—a man rather over
medium height, sunburnt, with a lean, clean-shaven face,
fair hair, and clean cut mouth and chin. That was all
she had time to take in before he raised his eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh!” ejaculated Bella, involuntarily, and then after
meeting a moment longer the wide, unwinking, upward
look, “How do you do!” she said.</p>

<p>“How do you do,” echoed the sunburnt man, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
did not bow nor move; just stood looking at the picture
up there on the wall.</p>

<p>Miss Bella was not as a rule easily embarrassed, but
she was conscious now of feeling a little at a loss.</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly why I am in such a hurry to
say ‘how do you do,’ that I can’t wait till I come down.
But I do know you, don’t I?”</p>

<p>“Of course you know me”; but that time he smiled,
and Bella said to herself, how <em>could</em> I have forgotten
anybody so—so—</p>

<p>She picked up her glove with the intention of running
down. But, I expect I look rather nice here in the window,
she reflected, and instead of going down instantly
she said: “It’s some time since I was here before.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a long time,” he answered. His tone
pleased her.</p>

<p>“And I run about the world such a lot, I can’t be expected
to remember everybody’s name just all at once,
can I?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the name doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>“Does that mean you aren’t quite sure of mine?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the faintest notion of it.”</p>

<p>“Then how do you know—what made you say, ‘Of
course I knew you’?”</p>

<p>“Because I was sure you did.”</p>

<p>“Why should I remember you, any more than you
should remember me? Are you somebody very special?”</p>

<p>“<em>Very</em> special.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll hear.”</p>

<p>“How shall I hear?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, go on.”</p>

<p>“I can’t, now.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“You—you’re too far off.”</p>

<p>“When I come down, you’ll tell me?”</p>

<p>“<em>Will</em> you?—will you ever come down?” He was
smiling.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I?” she said, bewildered.</p>

<p>“I never saw it tried before.”</p>

<p>“Never saw me try to come down-stairs!”</p>

<p>“Never, yet.”</p>

<p>Had he been here that time she sprained her ankle?
“Do you imagine I’m lame?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I’m ready to believe you have
wings. Please fly down.”</p>

<p>“What a very odd person you are! I can’t think how
I came to forget—”</p>

<p>He made no answer. Just stood there leaning against
the heavy table, half-smiling and never turning away his
eyes.</p>

<p>She caught up her glove and ran down several steps,
but just before she reached the open place where the
stair turned abruptly, and the solid wall gave way to a
procession of slender pillars, she stopped, overcome by a
sudden rush of shyness. Behind that last yard of sheltering
wall she waited breathless, while you might count
seven, and then turned on a noiseless foot and fled up-stairs,
bending low as she passed the square windows, so
that not even the top of her brown head should be visible
to that very odd man waiting for her down there in
the hall.</p>

<p>She reappeared ten minutes later with the first batch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of guests, and while they were speaking to their hostess,
the sunburnt man made his way to Bella, and held out
his hand.</p>

<p>“It took you a long time,” he said. “How did you
manage it?”</p>

<p>“Manage what?”</p>

<p>“Getting down. You’re the cleverest picture I ever
saw on any wall. How long do they give you?”</p>

<p>“Out of the frame?” she said, catching up his fancy
with a laugh. “Oh, only long enough to find out what
you’ve done to make you the special person you say you
are.”</p>

<p>“It’s not what I <em>have</em> done, but what I shall do.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m very much disappointed. I thought you
must be distinguished, and now I see you’re only conceited.”</p>

<p>He smiled—he was rather wonderful when he smiled.</p>

<p>“Of course, I know perfectly well we’ve met before,”
Bella went on, “but I don’t remember who you are.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you some day.”</p>

<p>“Some day? How absurd. Why not now?”</p>

<p>“Because the surprise might be too great.”</p>

<p>She opened her eyes yet wider and laughed as a girl
will in recognition of a point she sees as yet only with
the eye of faith. “Didn’t you promise you’d tell me
if I came down?”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t come down. You are still far out
of reach.”</p>

<p>“It’s ridiculous of you not to tell me your name.”</p>

<p>“My name wouldn’t mean anything to you—not yet.
You wouldn’t know it.”</p>

<p>“What!” She drew back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“But we have met,” he reassured her hurriedly.</p>

<p>“I felt we must have, but where was it?”</p>

<p>“I can’t quite remember, either. It may have been
when you were Queen in Babylon and I was a Christian
slave.”</p>

<p>She drew nearer with lit face. “Oh, do you believe
in all those delightful things?”</p>

<p>“I believe—” he began on a different and lower note
and then he stopped suddenly. Bella’s upturned face
silently begged him to go on with his profession of faith.</p>

<p>But just then, Bella’s brother, having passed a boring
guest on to his wife, came between the two who stood
so oblivious of the rest of the company. The apparition
of Tom Wayne brought Bella back to the every-day
world, and to a half-frightened self-criticism, in view of
the long flight she had taken from it in the last few seconds.</p>

<p>Her brother laid an affectionate hand on the shoulder
of the sunburnt man, and said, laughing, to Bella: “You
must be careful with this person. He’s the most desperate
flirt.”</p>

<p>Bella winced inwardly, but she disguised the little
hurt with smiling mockery. “Really! I should <em>never</em>
have thought it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, goes off with first one heart and then another.
And he goes so far! That’s the worst of him.”</p>

<p>“Where does he go?”</p>

<p>“Lord knows! Let’s see, what God-forgotten place
was the last book about?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you write books? Then you <em>are</em> distinguished—”</p>

<p>“You aren’t telling me you didn’t know who it
was?” exclaimed her brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I thought I did, and I’ve been behaving as if I
did.”</p>

<p>There was a general movement to the dining-room,
but Tom paused long enough to say with mock formality:
“Miss Wayne, Mr. John Galbraith.”</p>

<p>“<em>Oh!</em>” ejaculated the girl, growing pink with
excitement. “Are you Hildegarde’s Jack?”</p>

<p>The sunburnt man looked mystified a moment, and
then with sudden daring, “Is your name Hildegarde?”
he said.</p>

<p>This was on the twenty-fourth of September. Six
days later she began a letter to her friend.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Oh, Hildegarde! Hildegarde! You’re quite right.
He’s the most wonderful person in the world, and I hope
you don’t mind, but we are engaged to be married—Jack
Galbraith and I! It turns out that he’s an old friend of
Marion’s family, and after she married my brother, when
Jack came to see them last winter, Tom liked him awfully—of
course everybody does that—and since then
they’ve all three been great friends.</p>

<p>“And one of the first things he asked me when he
heard Tom came from near Valdivia, was all about you—I
mean your father. He says such beautiful things about
your father, and how kind he was when Jack was a poor,
forlorn, little boy. But oh, Hildegarde! he’s the most
glorious person now you ever saw in your life. The old
faded photograph isn’t a bit like him. I am sending you
a new one, and that isn’t like him, either. But I am going
to get a silver frame for it and I shall be dreadfully
hurt if you don’t put it on the altar-table, with the old
locket and the roses—if you’re really glad of our happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
you’ll even burn a joss now and then for our sake.
I’m miserable when I think how little good any photograph
of such a person is! You can’t imagine what it’s
like when he smiles. All the whole earth smiles, too. I
adore him when he smiles—and when he doesn’t. I adore
him every minute, except when he talks about Franz
Josef Land, or something disgusting like that. But then
he doesn’t do it much—never, except when Mr. Borisoff
is here. Mr. Borisoff is a man I can’t stop to tell you
about, only I don’t like him, and I shall let Jack know
some day that I don’t think he is a good influence.</p>

<p>“But I began to say that you mustn’t think Jack is
the least solemn as his letters used to sound and as the
pictures make out. In fact, he began our acquaintance
by flirting quite desperately, but he says it wasn’t flirting
at all. He meant all those things! He says they
were a profession of faith upon a miraculous revelation
(that’s me—I’m the miraculous revelation!), and it
only sounded flirtatious because I didn’t realize, as he
did, that we had been waiting for one another.</p>

<p>“He’s waited a good deal longer than I have, poor
Jack! He’s more than twelve years older than I am;
do you remember how you used to throw that in my face?
But it doesn’t matter the least in the world. Besides,
you’d never think he was so old—he’s such a darling;
and he talks like a poet, and a painter, and an archangel,
all rolled into one. I am so wildly happy I can’t write
a proper letter, only I do want you to know that your
mother is mistaken, as we always thought. Jack is a
saint—simply a saint. When my father behaved quite
horridly, and said he couldn’t have me marrying a man
who went away for two or three years on long, scientific
expeditions, Jack said he wouldn’t do it any more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
though I think it cost him something to say that. He
was quite silent for hours afterward, and didn’t even
notice I’d done my hair differently. And that horrid
Mr. Borisoff was in such a rage. He didn’t say anything,
but oh! he looked. But now he’s gone away,
thank goodness, and I shall try to make Jack not ever
see him again. Then another thing, just to show you
what a perfect angel Jack is. My mother said I was delicate
and too young, and things like that, and she got
father to agree that I was only eighteen and was the
weakling of the family, and they made up their wicked
old minds that I mustn’t be married right away as Jack
and I had arranged. And what do you think? Jack
said he would wait for me? A whole year! I cried when
they settled that, but wasn’t he a seraph? Fathers and
mothers are very selfish; I shall not treat my daughters
like that.</p>

<p>“How Jack and I will ever get through a year of waiting
is more than either of us know. I am not coming home
till the first week in December, and Jack’s coming to us
for Christmas. And then you’ll see him! I hope you
are pleased that I’m going to marry the man we’ve
talked so much about. It seems like another bond,
doesn’t it? How is Louis Cheviot? I can forgive him
now for always liking you best. I can’t imagine how I
ever looked at him. Oh, Hildegarde, Jack is a perfect—well,
I never heard the word that was beautiful enough
to describe him.</p>

<p>“Good-by, I hear him now out in the garden. Jack is
the most perfect whistler.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-d.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">December did not bring Galbraith—nor
even Bella.</p>

<p>“Jack found he couldn’t leave that
odious Mr. Borisoff to settle up some business
all alone, but my brother Tom has got
mama to consent to stay over Christmas with me in New
York at Marion’s. So Jack and I shan’t die, as we fully
intended to if we were separated.”</p>

<p>Just as the girl and her mother, early in the new year,
were at last going home, a cable came from England to
say that Bella’s sister, Mrs. Hilton, had been badly hurt
in a carriage accident.</p>

<p>The cable was couched in the most alarming terms—there
seemed to be every prospect of three little children
being left motherless. Bella and her mother took the first
ship that sailed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If we have to stay any time, Jack says he will come
over.”</p>

</div>

<p>They did stay, and Jack was as good as his word. Mrs.
Hilton did not die, but she lay for months in a critical
condition, and her mother mounted guard over the new
baby and the three other little people.</p>

<p>Bella meanwhile was amusing herself right royally.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I’ve been presented and I’m having a perfect, rapturous
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now it’s decided we don’t have to wait quite a
whole year—we are going to be married before we come
back to America, some time in the summer. Just think
of it, Hildegarde! You and I not to meet again till I’m
married! Oh, do write and say you’ll love me just as
much as ever.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then for a time no more long letters, but a shower of
happy little notes, that descended with tolerable regularity.
After that, the wedding invitation! Ten days’
interval and then two communications by the same mail.
The first:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Dearest Hildegarde</span>:</p>

<p>“Mother and I are just back from a week-end at
Tryston. It was rather dull. All the men were immensely
distinguished and at least eighty. I was glad
to get back to town. Hengler’s Circus has been turned
into a skating-rink. We all went to a delightful party
there last week. The wife of the Governor-General of
Canada skated most wonderfully. I wish I could. Jack
didn’t take his eyes off her. Mr. Borisoff has come to
London. I hate Mr. Borisoff as much as ever, if not
worse.</p>

<p>“I haven’t time for more if I’m to catch this post.
But I can’t have you thinking I forget you in my happiness.
Besides, I shall be happier when Mr. Borisoff goes
back to his fellow-barbarians, and leaves me and Jack
alone. The next, I promise, shall be a great, long letter.
You’ll see! I do love you, Hildegarde.</p>

<p class="center">“From your loving</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Bella</span>.</p>

<p>“P. S. I wish you were here.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>It struck Hildegarde it was the first time she had said
that since Jack had appeared on the scene.</p>

<p>The other letter was without date or beginning.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Jack and I have quarreled. Oh, if you were here!</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Bella.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>Immediately after, a mysterious cable, that told simply
the date of Bella’s homeward sailing. Had the quarrel
frightened her lover and so hastened on the marriage?
But no, for while Bella was still upon the sea came a
formal notice that the marriage was “postponed.” It
had been mailed some days before the cable was sent.</p>

<p class="tb">Hildegarde’s first feeling upon Bella’s return was that
since the writing of that final note from London, and the
dispatching of the postponement notice, the trouble,
whatever it had been, was patched up. Impossible to
think there was a cloud in her sky. Not matured at all;
only a little thinner and, save for that, exactly the same
Bella—“unthinking, idle, wild, and young.”</p>

<p>But as the minutes went by and she ran from one
familiar thing to another in garden and house, with
greeting and gay comment, spinning out the time till
she and Hildegarde should be alone together, the older
girl began to have her doubts. Was Bella as happy as
she pretended, flitting about with all her “dear Mars?”</p>

<p>Nothing possible to gather from her eagerness to be
assured that so far from being forgotten, she was more
than ever an object of interest and devotion. Nothing
new Bella’s little weakness for wanting everybody to be
visibly enlivened by her return from “abroad,” bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
her adorable frocks (for Bella’s American mama had
come into money, and Bella was helping her to come out
of a certain portion), bringing remembrances for everybody,
bringing a whiff of foreign airs, and a touch of
something exciting, exotic, into the lives of stay-at-home
folk. Bella had always been one of those who, however
much adored, would like to be adored yet a little more.
She couldn’t bear that any one within reach of her influence
should escape caring about her, and she cast a
net uncommon wide. It was meant to enmesh even
Hildegarde’s mother, partly because that lady was so
little lavish in bestowing her affection, but mostly because
if you were much in the Mar house it mattered
enormously upon what terms you were with Mrs. Mar.
But, as ill-luck would have it, Bella never thought of the
lady once she was away from her. Though she had
brought back scarf-pins for the boys, and a silver-mounted
blackthorn for Mr. Mar, and a quite wonderful
necklace for Hildegarde, there was nothing—nothing at
all for Mrs. Mar—and it was serious.</p>

<p>Bella never realized the awful omission till, having
dispensed the other gifts, she stood with the rest of the
family in the garden, not even asking where Mrs. Mar
was, till looking up, she saw that lady at her bedroom
window carefully trying on a new pair of gloves.
“Everything depends on the way they’re put on the
first time.” Bella could hear her saying it, and she
looked up smiling and waving her hand, as much as to
say, “Oh, please hurry down! <em>You’re</em> the person I’m
pining most of all to see again.” But, of herself, Miss
Bella was silently asking, “What <em>am</em> I to do! What will
happen if she should see she’s the only one I’ve forgotten?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Bella’s brain worked feverishly. Glancing down,
her eye fell on a gold pencil she was wearing on a chain.
Surreptitiously detaching this latest gift of her mother’s,
Bella slipped it in her pocket, talking all the time; telling
Mr. Mar what it felt like to see sunshine, real Californian
sunshine again; offering up to public scorn the English
girl who had disapproved of the unappreciative Californians
for rooting arum lilies out of their gardens, and
throwing them away in sheaves, which Bella admitted
was what they did with the “pest.” “Just like your
American extravagance,” the English girl had said.</p>

<p>Oh, it was so perfectly heavenly to be at home again!
Bella beamed in her old conscienceless way at poor Trenn,
who found a heady tonic—a hope new born, in hearing
the adored one call the Mar house “home.”</p>

<p>But even while he was savoring the sweetness of that
thought, there was the distracting creature linking her
arm in Harry’s, and saying: “Come away a moment
and tell me something I want to know.”</p>

<p>What could a boy like Harry possibly tell Bella that
she could want to know!</p>

<p>Harry’s own huge satisfaction in the incident was
cruelly damped upon Bella’s saying: “Does your mother
still love stumps?”</p>

<p>“Stumps! Love s-stumps!” he muttered, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes. You haven’t forgotten how she always kept
her pencils till they were so little nobody else could have
held on to them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that kind. Yes. Stumps! I see.”</p>

<p>“Well, does she dote on them as much as ever? Does
she pick them out of the fender, when Mr. Mar has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
thrown his away? Does she still say: ‘Well, <em>I’m</em> not so
well off that I can put a thing in the fire that’s only
half-used?’ Does she do that the same as ever, or are you
all too rich now?”</p>

<p>Harry laughed. “Oh, we’ll never be so rich that
mother won’t use a pencil to its last grasp.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’ve got the very thing for her! A nice
gold one—pencil, you know. But rather a stump, too.
See?—just her size!”</p>

<p>Harry looked doubtfully down upon the somewhat
massive pencil-case which Bella had drawn from her
pocket and was telescoping in and out. “That’s an
awfully fine one, but I can’t quite imagine mother giving
up her—”</p>

<p>“Well, look here,” interrupted Bella, “Mrs. Mar’s a
person you can’t take risks with. Do you mind going
up-stairs and showing her this? Just ask her what she
thinks of it—as though I’d brought it to you, you
know.” Harry departed on the errand, while Bella
returned to the others, but her emissary was back directly
with a doubtful face, and Mrs. Mar following not far
behind.</p>

<p>“Well?” Bella demanded in an undertone.</p>

<p>“Oh—a—I asked her if she didn’t think it was an
awfully fine one, and all she said was: ‘The Lord was
very good. He had delivered her many years ago from
gold pencils.’”</p>

<p>“What on earth does she mean?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t the ghost—’Sh!”</p>

<p>“Oh, how do you do, dear Mrs. Mar!” Bella flew to
embrace the lady, who received the advance with self-possession,
but not without a glint of pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry still stood with the intended tribute in his hand.
Mrs. Mar’s eye fell upon it critically.</p>

<p>“Is it true—a—you don’t think much of gold pencils?”
hazarded Bella.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you’re a person of leisure—”</p>

<p>“What’s that got to do with it?”</p>

<p>“It’s a pursuit in itself, keeping a gold pencil going.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. Look. This one goes beautifully.” Bella
took it from Harry and shot it in and out.</p>

<p>“That’s just its wiliness. Wait till you <em>need</em> it.”</p>

<p>“Really this one’s very good. It’s warranted—”</p>

<p>“<em>I’ll</em> warrant it’ll always be wanting a new lead.
Especially at the moment when you can’t possibly stop
to niggle about with fitting one in. Then you’ll put the
thing away till you can take an afternoon off just to
get your handsome gold pencil into working order again.
And when you’ve done that and gone thoroughly into
the subject, you’ll find there isn’t a store on the Pacific
coast that keeps your size leads. No lead in any store
will ever fit your pencil. Then you’ll write to New
York to a manufactory. Then you’ll wait a month,
maybe two. Then, by the time you’ve got them, you’ll
find the pencil has forgotten how to assimilate leads. It
will break them off short and spit them out. If you try
to discipline the pencil, it’ll turn sulky and refuse to
open. Or it stays open and refuses to shut.”</p>

<p>“I assure you, Mrs. Mar, <em>this</em> one—”</p>

<p>“And I assure you, Miss Bella Wayne, that even if
you’re under the special favor of Providence, and none
of these things happen, you’ll still find you can never
get the work out of a twenty-dollar gold pencil that you
can out of a five-cent cedar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Bella was catching Harry’s eye and trying not to
laugh.</p>

<p>“And remember what I tell you,” Mrs. Mar wound
up, “you’ll have to treat that gold pencil as you treat
Mrs. Harrington Trennor, with reverence and awe. If you
don’t you’ll be sorry. If you lean on it, it will collapse.
If you do anything but admire it, it will teach you better.”
Bella opened her lips—Mrs. Mar stopped her with,
“Unless you come to my way of thinking, you’ll use
that pencil in fear and trembling till the merciful grave
offers you a refuge from your slavery. As I told Harry”—she
buttoned the last button on her new gloves (why
hadn’t Bella brought her anything as sensible as
gloves!) and she drew down her cuff with a business-like
air—“the Lord has delivered me from many snares; gold
pencils among the rest!” And she marched off toward
the gate.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother,” said Hildegarde, at her side, “how
could you! That dear little Bella brought the beautiful
gold pencil for you all the way from Europe.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose I didn’t guess that? Good-by!”
She looked back and nodded to Bella. “I’ve got to go to
the missionary meeting now, but I’ll see you at supper.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and you’ll tell me the rest then?” asked the
wicked Bella, with an innocent look.</p>

<p>“The rest!” Mrs. Mar glanced sharply over her shoulder
as she laid her hand on the latch of the gate. “There
is no rest for anybody who depends on a contrivance like
that. Whenever I see a person with a gold pencil, I
know it won’t be long before she’s asking me to lend
her my wooden stump. As a rule she likes my wooden
stump so well she walks off with it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>As Mrs. Mar vanished round the corner, Bella gave
way to suppressed chuckles. Impossible to think she
had a care in the world greater than a rejected gold
pencil.</p>

<p>“Yes, Hildegarde. I’m coming directly; only Trenn
hasn’t given me a spray of lemon verbena yet, to console
me for the scandalous way his mother treats me. Don’t
you remember you <em>always</em> give me lemon verbena when
we’re in the garden?” She showed no impatience when
Trenn prolonged the time-honored process—not a bit of
it, went on laughing and chattering there in the sunshine
and telling how they thought in England that the American
girl was only keeping up the transatlantic reputation
for “telling tall stories,” when Bella had said that verbena
at home was a tree, and grew to the second-story
window. Then having undone in half an hour any good
of peace regained by the “Mar boys” through her absence
and engagement, Miss Bella found her way up-stairs.</p>

<p>Her vivacity fell visibly from the moment she crossed
the threshold of Hildegarde’s familiar little room. But
she commented favorably upon the new home-worked
counterpane, and then, as though without seeing it,
walked past the familiar old altar-table, with its ferny
background and the roses ranged below. There was the
big silver locket hung above, like some peasant’s votive
offering at a foreign shrine, and down there in front
of the massed roses was that other picture, that had
been new only a year ago, when Bella’s happiness was
born.</p>

<p>She went straight to the window and stood quite silent,
looking down upon Hildegarde’s flower borders. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
without turning round, “Will you do something for
me?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Take that picture away. The locket, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bella! Is it as bad as that?”</p>

<p>“You’ll put them out of sight?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; of course I will.”</p>

<p>“<em>Now!</em>” She might as well have said: I won’t turn
round until they’re gone.</p>

<p>Hildegarde opened a drawer. “I’ll put them in here
till things come right again.”</p>

<p>“Things aren’t ever coming right.”</p>

<p>“Bella!”</p>

<p>Not till she heard the drawer shut did the girl turn
from the window, and Hildegarde could see that the
small face was quivering.</p>

<p>“Bella, dear!” Her friend swept to her on a sudden
wave of pity. “It will all come right.”</p>

<p>But the younger girl drew back. Although her tears
were brimming she spoke with a certain half-choked
hardness: “I’ve hurried mother back as fast as boats
and trains could bring us; just to be with you again, but
not to hear you say that. I wanted to be with you just
because you will know better. Hildegarde—I—I’d like
to stay with you awhile. May I?”</p>

<p>“I want nothing so much—we all want you.”</p>

<p>“Trenn, too?” she actually laughed through her tears.
What a queer creature.</p>

<p>“Trenn, too. Only”—Hildegarde glanced from the
empty place on the altar-table, to the shut drawer—“only
you’ll be kind enough not to break Trenn’s heart
as well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“As well as my own?”</p>

<p>Hildegarde’s face grew hard with the words, “As
well as Jack Galbraith’s.”</p>

<p>Bella, too, was grave enough now; “I haven’t broken
his heart. But—I’ve got a crack in my own. Only”—she
lifted her pretty eyes with an air almost of panic—“only
nobody else is to know. You”—she came nearer
and laid a nervous hand on Hildegarde’s firm arm—“you
must help me to keep everybody from knowing.”</p>

<p>“Dear,” was all Hildegarde’s answer, but she leaned
her cheek against Bella’s thin face.</p>

<p>“And there’s another thing,” the younger girl went on
a little feverishly, still clinging to Hildegarde’s arm, “I
hate talking about it.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Just at first, it must be—”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t ‘of course’ and it’s not only at first.
It’s for always. Most girls talk their love affairs to tatters.
I’ve noticed that. I want you to help me to—to
keep my—” Her voice went out upon a sudden flood of
tears. Hildegarde drew her into the window-seat and sat
down beside her. They were silent for a time, until Bella
laid her wet face down on her friend’s shoulder with,
“Mind, Hildegarde! We aren’t to talk about it. Not
even you and I. John Galbraith is too—too—” She
raised her head, drew her small hand across her eyes,
and then sprang up and faced the window, as if some
enemy without had challenged her. “It may be that I
<em>don’t</em> understand what a great man he is, as Mr. Borisoff
says. But, at least, I know he’s not the sort of person to
be chattered over.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde remembered with a sting how for years she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
had “chattered” with Galbraith for her theme. And
she hadn’t little Bella’s excuse. Yes, it was always like
this. She was for ever stumbling upon something dignified
and fine in Butterfly Bella.</p>

<p>The pretty tear-stained face was lifted to the sunlight,
and the childish red mouth, so used to laughter, was pitifully
grave, as Bella, staring up into the square of sky
over Hildegarde’s head said: “He is up there!”</p>

<p>“Jack!” Hildegarde exclaimed in a half-whisper.</p>

<p>“John Galbraith,” said Bella. “He is way up there,
and I won’t be the one to pull him down.”</p>

<p>“Oh-h. I was half afraid you meant he was dead.”</p>

<p>“As good as dead.”</p>

<p>Fear took fresh hold on the older girl. He is going to
marry some one else, Hildegarde said to herself. Yes,
yes; as she looked at poor Bella’s face, she was sure of it.
And now the slim little figure had sunk on its knees. She
leaned against her friend for support. But she looked
out across Hildegarde’s shoulder, searching space
through tears. Hildegarde held tight the childish-looking
hands, and asked the last question she was ever to
put about the common hero of their girlhood. “Where
is he?” she said.</p>

<p>“He’s gone off with Mr. Borisoff somewhere.”</p>

<p>“You mean you don’t know where?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere in the arctic.” She hid her face in Hildegarde’s
lap.</p>

<p>They sat so a long, long time.</p>

<p class="tb">In spite of her year’s absence, Bella found nothing much
changed in the Valdivia situation, except that the Mar
boys had “got on” more than ever, and that their father’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
form of progress seemed still more strikingly to consist
in “getting on” in years.</p>

<p>It was a long time since his wife had given him the credit
for doing more than his share at the bank with a view to
promotion to be head cashier, or even a “silent partner.”
Each time a vacancy occurred some one else had stepped
into it; Louis Cheviot had been the last. But Mrs. Mar
learned through the years that the reason her husband
accepted increased tasks was that he was born to bear
burdens, as the sparks to fly upward. If any extra work
was “going,” so to speak, it gravitated unerringly to
Nathaniel Mar. As to the question of his reward, what
would be gained by giving a better position to a man who
in any crisis could be depended on to do all the work of a
higher office, and never ask for increased emolument?
The only person who ever hinted such a thing to the
Trennors had been Cousin Harriet. The Trennor Brothers’
success (which was proverbial in Valdivia) had long
extended to avoidance of Cousin Harriet. Certainly Mr.
Mar’s life-long ill-luck brought out more clearly the fact
of his boys’ early prosperity. Not that it was enormous
as yet, though quite sufficient to have enabled them to
marry, had they so chosen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar’s satisfaction in her sons was checkered by
the fact that each of these otherwise reasonable and enterprising
young men clung to his boyish infatuation for
Bella Wayne, long after their boyhood had gone the way
of the years. It certainly did seem as though not till
one or both were cut out by her marrying some one else,
would either Trenn or Harry look at any of the girls
Mrs. Mar considered more desirable. Not that the boys’
mother had been able wholly to escape the general Mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
devotion to the disturber of their peace, but as the seasons
passed, and Bella rejected one swain after another,
it became increasingly vexatious to Mrs. Mar that her
sons should not realize and amend the stupidity of caring
about a girl who was more and more under suspicion of
being handicapped by a silly passion for a mad fool who
had given up the substance for the shadow, and had met
his due reward—being now these many months lost in
the arctic ice.</p>

<p class="tb">Hildegarde’s theory that since the unhappy issue of the
love affair, Bella had greater need of her friend than
ever before, and Hildegarde’s own consequent inaccessibility
to others was the cause of some restiveness on Cheviot’s
part. His old friendliness for Bella had vanished.
He spoke of her with a humorous disparagement that did
him ill-service with Hildegarde. But he was grave
enough sometimes.</p>

<p>“I never get a word alone with you, nowadays,” he
said one night, as he sat smoking on the steps of the
porch at Hildegarde’s feet, while Bella walked about the
garden with Trenn. Hildegarde made some perfunctory
answer, and they sat silent for a time.</p>

<p>The light wind brought up waves of fragrance from
the tangle of roses under Hildegarde’s window, and the
little path stretched away to indefiniteness in the starlight,
till it was lost long before it reached the garden’s
end. The limits of the narrow inclosure, so sharply
drawn by day, were nobly enlarged, lost even, at this
hour, in the dim reaches of green turned silver and
black, as the moon came over the tops of the conifers.</p>

<p>Down by the arbor vitæ hedge growing things that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Hildegarde had planted sent their souls to her across the
lawn, piercing the heavier air of roses with arrowy
shafts of spicy sweetness.</p>

<p>On such a night no one is alone. Where two go down
a darkling walk, or sit on the steps in the dusk, others
gather round them. Invisible presences—the singers,
the beautiful ones, the stern doers of great deeds—join
us common folk, and give us a share in their glory or
their steadfast pain. Hopes of our own, that look too
large by day—too dim and inaccessible, they come
walking in our garden at such an hour, beckoning us or
looking, smiling, on. Living men, rumored to be far
away, suddenly stand before us. Women who have been
long aloof draw near. All the barriers go down. Even
the dead come home.</p>

<p>John Galbraith was down there, where Bella’s white
gown shone among the trees, and John Galbraith was
sitting between those other two on the steps.</p>

<p>And Cheviot knew it.</p>

<p>Hildegarde was reminded of the visible presence by
his saying, in a low voice, that he understood the reason
of his ill-success with her.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bella told me. Years ago. When she was so
little you thought she—”</p>

<p>“Told you what?”</p>

<p>“That you had been in love with John Galbraith since
you were sixteen.”</p>

<p>“But you must see that’s absurd. I’ve never even
seen him!”</p>

<p>“I wish to God you had! Then you might get over
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Hildegarde roused herself to say with equal emphasis,
“You are really talking the greatest foolishness—”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you got his picture in your room this moment?”</p>

<p>“I have the picture he—had taken for Bella.”</p>

<p>“Before he ever met Bella you had a picture of Galbraith.
You used to wear it. Bella said—”</p>

<p>“You seem to forget you’re talking about what happened
when I was a little school-girl, and about an old—a
very old friend of my family. We all have pictures
of Mr. Galbraith—and, why, there’s one of you there,
too.”</p>

<p>“On the altar?”</p>

<p>(Oh, Bella! Bella! How could you!) “The one on
the flower-table was put there because Bella asked me to.
It’s not there any more. And while it was, I looked
upon it as the future husband of my dearest friend.”</p>

<p>But the description of Bella sounded suddenly ironic.
It hurt. For Cheviot was the man who all along had
laughed at girls’ friendships, and all along he had
known that Bella was capable of—</p>

<p>“It isn’t that I couldn’t forgive you for not being in
love with me,” he said. “But for being in love with a
photograph and a packet of letters—<em>no!</em> that wasn’t
easy. At the same time I knew well enough that if your
life hadn’t been so narrow, you wouldn’t have been so
at the mercy of this one romantic figure in it. If you’d
been able to travel, or even to go to the university—if
you’d had <em>any</em> other door open, you wouldn’t have
looked so long out of that one window.”</p>

<p>A scrap of one of Mrs. Browning’s letters flew across
her mind—the dearer somehow for being a little incoherent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
not fitted together at all, yet finely consequent
to the inner spirit—those words: “The pleasantest place
in the house is the leaning out of the window.”</p>

<p>Ah, it was very true of the Mar house.</p>

<p>“And your mother,” Cheviot went on, “always ready
to puncture any home-blown bubble with the needle of
her wit; mercilessly critical, for fear her children should
have too low standards; ready to flay anybody alive in
the cause of education. Never letting you rest satisfied
for a moment with the attainable—you must always be
reaching out—reaching out—and when you reached out
you touched Galbraith.”</p>

<p>How strangely well he knew—this man. It was odd,
but she could never again think him obtuse, at any rate.
That comfort was gone.</p>

<p>“I was even sorry for you while the engagement
lasted,” the low voice went on, unmindful of the uneasy
stir of the figure sitting above him in the dusk. He took
the half-smoked cigar from his lips and laid it by the
pillar. Over the edge of the porch the tip shone red.
“I saw how hard it was for you; you had been weaving
romances round Galbraith for years—you had looked
upon him for so long as your special property—” Hildegarde
drew back into the deeper shadow. But by his
own suffering urged to win a companion in pain, he persisted:
“And you thought if it had been <em>you</em> he had met,
it would have been you that he—” Hildegarde’s skirts
rustled as if she were getting up—“Look here, I’ve told
you before you’ve got a genius for truth—I’m treating
you on that basis.” She said nothing, but she sat still.
“There was a moment,” Cheviot’s voice was unnaturally
low, “last spring, when I knew I was gaining ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
with you. It was the day I came back from Mexico. I
came here straight from the station, and you—you—”
She heard him strike his hands suddenly together in the
dusk, and a curious excitement took hold of her. “When
I went home, I found the invitation to Bella’s wedding.
It had been lying there for days. Then I understood.
You had had all those days and nights to get accustomed
to realizing it was the end of the old—where are
you going? Can’t you even bear to have me speak of it
this once!”</p>

<p>The white figure was still again.</p>

<p>“Oh, I understood!” He picked up the cigar again.
“I felt just the same as you did. I knew the ghost that
had stood so long between us was suddenly gone. He
had moved out of the way, and you could see that I was
there. For those next days you were—you were—I
was full of hope. Then came word that Bella had broken
her engagement.”</p>

<p>“No, that the marriage was postponed.”</p>

<p>He waited a moment, seemed about to speak, and
then, instead of saying anything, with a sharp movement
he threw his half-smoked cigar across the whitening silver
of the path into the inky blotch the shrubbery made.
Hildegarde’s eyes followed the flying red light till,
against a tree trunk, it fell in a splash of sparks, and was
swallowed up in shadow.</p>

<p>“I shan’t forget,” Cheviot went on, still on that low
restrained note, “the look in your face as you said: ‘I
never thought they were suited to one another. It would
never have done.’”</p>

<p>“<em>Did</em> I say that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I looked up and I saw the ghost was there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
again, and presently I saw he wasn’t a ghost any longer,
but a real man. An active expectation on your part—”</p>

<p>“No, no.” The voice was less denial than beseeching.</p>

<p>“Yes, a <em>plan</em>.”</p>

<p>The hands that were gripping the wicker chair pulled
her quickly to her feet. “Bella!” she called to the white
flicker by the dial. “It’s getting late!”</p>

<p>Cheviot stood up, too. “On your honor, Hildegarde—”
Was it the moonlight blanched her, or was
she indeed so white? His heart smote him—but, “On
your honor can you deny it?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, with sudden passion; “I don’t deny
it.” And while her words should have steeled him, her
voice brought a lump to his throat.</p>

<p>“You mean,” he asked, huskily, “to wait till John
Galbraith comes back?”</p>

<p>“I know it’s quite mad—but there! A thing can take
you like that. You <em>can’t</em> change.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">With the precision of clockwork, every day of
his life but Sundays, Nathaniel Mar walked
down the main street of Valdivia to the
bank. People who lived out of sight of the
City Hall timepiece, set their watches by
the appearance of the lame man with the stick. He never
varied the route, any more than he altered his time, and
both had been exactly the same for twenty-eight years.</p>

<p>The other bank cashiers (few of them over thirty)
said that, in their opinion, Mr. Mar had hung on quite
long enough. They did not hesitate to add that his post
would have fallen to a younger man years ago had Mar
not been “a sort of relation.” Even so it was pretty
steep that an old codger of sixty should be blocking up
the way like that. A bank was no place for the superannuated,
unless, of course, a man was a director.</p>

<p>So acute was the hearing of the old codger (who was
not yet sixty) that sotto-voce observations of this sort
had, from time to time, reached his ears.</p>

<p>He saw all about him men, younger than himself,
turned out of positions they had occupied, with usefulness
and integrity, for years, and for no other reason
than to make way for some “boy” in his early twenties.
Men of his own standing had from time to time in the
past decade raged hopelessly against this tendency in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
nation, where the great god, Efficiency, demands the fine
flower of each man’s life, and looks with disfavor upon
lined faces and whitening hair, even when the capacity
for service is unimpaired. It is part of the doctrine of
“<em>show me</em>.” There being any good, or any force not
capable of being “shown”—well, it was doubtful. Best
not take chances.</p>

<p>Mar had sympathized with his contemporaries for being
elbowed out of their places, but he had smiled at one
or two who had suffered the common fate of the American
clerk, in spite of having dyed their hair, and worn
jaunty pince-nez instead of “good honest spectacles.”
Nevertheless, Mar’s own secret uneasiness—not being
assuaged by hair dye or dissipated by pince-nez—took
the form of making him the more ready to be the Trennor
Brothers’ pack-horse, unconsciously the more eager
to oblige any and everybody at the bank, to “show”
from Monday morning to Saturday afternoon how indispensable
he was. He knew they could get no one to do
what he did with the same care and assiduity for the
same salary. His astonishment was, therefore, hardly
less than his chagrin, when he found upon his desk, one
morning, a letter from the firm “terminating their long
and pleasant connection upon the usual notice.”</p>

<p>In the bitterness of that hour he felt that nothing he
ever had suffered before had mattered so vitally. As
long as a man has work he can bear trouble and disappointment—life
without work—it was something not to
be faced. For the work, little by little, had devoured
everything else, narrowed down his friendships, cut off
his recreations, produced a brain-fag that made him unfit
even for reading anything but newspapers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>He set instantly about finding another post. The story
of the days that followed—the writing to and interviewing
whippersnapper young managers of flourishing concerns,
and of being more or less cavalierly “turned
down,” as the slang phrase went—it would make a book
of itself; a tragic and significant book to boot, and one
essentially “American.”</p>

<p>The Mar boys behaved very well. <em>They</em>, at least, were
not surprised. They had, in point of fact, expected the
occurrence long before.</p>

<p>What they had not expected was that the old man
“would take it so mighty hard.” Why, he could scarcely
be more cut up if he were alone in the world—dependent
entirely upon his own exertions—instead of having two
fine go-ahead sons, who were getting on in life so rapidly
that it really wasn’t a matter of vital importance
whether the old man did anything or not; for they had
every intention of being good to their father.</p>

<p>They told him so. And he had not shown himself
grateful. And <em>still</em> they meant to be “good” to him.
They were “mighty nice young men.”</p>

<p class="tb">Nathaniel Mar saw clearly by the time the “notice”
was up, that he lagged superfluous. There was no opening
for him anywhere.</p>

<p>The first morning that he had no right to go down to
the bank was one of the most difficult he had known. He
went out just the same, at precisely the same moment,
and came in at the usual time. No one knew where he
had spent those hours, but he looked tired and ill when
he sat down to the midday meal. After it was over, he
said he thought he would “go up and lie down.” He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
had never done such a thing before in his life, at that
hour of the day. The following mornings he spent at his
writing-table in the dining-room, and although there
were no screaming children there now, and the room
was bright and pretty, he sat miserably, day after day,
turning over old letters and papers, till in despair he
would get up and take down a book to read. But his
thoughts were all “down at the bank.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar dashed in and out, called brisk directions to
the Chinaman, who presided now in the kitchen, and
when there was nothing else to do, she would fly at the
sewing-machine. This appeared to be the kind of
mechanism which was worked with the whole human
body. The hands traveling briskly along with the moving
seam, head going like a mandarin’s, knees up, knees
down, Mrs. Mar pedaled and buzzed away.</p>

<p>Her husband seldom spoke. Having retired within
himself directly after the breakfast things were cleared
away, he seemed to be averse from making the smallest
movement while his wife was in the room. He sat there
intensely still, even turning the leaf of his book only at
long intervals, surreptitiously, without a sound. It was
as though, by a death-like stillness, he should prove that
he was not there. He was really down at the bank—his
motionlessness seemed to say.</p>

<p>As if Mrs. Mar divined this mental ruse of his, and felt
a need to unmask it, she would look at him sideways, and
“What are you doing?” she would ask briskly.</p>

<p>“Reading.”</p>

<p>“That old Franklin again? Why, you’ve read it
three or four times already!” No answer. “Why don’t
you get something up-to-date from the library?” Still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
no response. “Content just to sit <em>and sit</em>!” she would
comment inwardly. Then aloud, “Don’t they want a
manager up at Smithson’s?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you try for the secretaryship of the
New Pickwick?”</p>

<p>“Monty Fellowes has got it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, I suppose Monty Fellowes went the length
of asking for it.”</p>

<p>Nathaniel Mar had also gone that length, though the
post was beneath a man of his powers. But he could not
tell over again at home the tale of his failures. Better
she should think he hadn’t tried.</p>

<p>But, oh, the very look of him sat upon her spirit, and
still she looked.</p>

<p>“You’ll be ill if you stay in the house so much. Remember
you’ve had a walk twice a day for going on
thirty years.” No answer. His immobility made it a
positive necessity for her to get up and poke the fire
vigorously, or do something with might and main. That
was a thing <em>he</em> had never tried in his life—to do something
with might and main! And that was why he was
stranded like this now. A man of only fifty-eight! Why,
she herself—Harriet T. Mar—was fifty-nine. And just
see how <em>she</em> took hold of existence—very much as she
gripped the poker. Oh, it was a trial living in the same
house, and all day long in the same room with a “logy”
man! He was more sodden with failure every day he
lived. Misfortune acted upon him like an opiate. Ha!
If she—Harriet T. Mar—were <em>ninety</em>, misfortune would
sting her into action. At the mere thought she sprang
up and stung her husband, or the imperturbable Mongol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in the kitchen, or the gentle Hildegarde. But truth to
tell, though that girl <em>looked</em> such a tender, simple creature,
it was as little rewarding to wrestle with Hildegarde
as with Mar, or the stolid Chinaman.</p>

<p>Indeed, the more the mother bustled the quieter grew
the girl—not at first consciously as a form of protest, but
by a process of natural reaction that was largely responsible
for Hildegarde’s seeming calm to the verge of insensibility.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar never wholly realized how much to the mother’s
exuberant energy the daughter owed her impassive air.
These influences playing about sensitive
people produce a curious rhythm in family life. Nathaniel
Mar’s supineness made his wife seize the reins and
ceaselessly whip up the horses of their car. Mrs. Mar’s
frantic urging of the pace, the dust and noise and whip-cracking
of her progress, produced not merely a yearning
for peace in Hildegarde’s mind, but a positive physical
need to simulate it. People talk much of the value
of good example, forgetting that we are sometimes shown
there is nothing so salutary as a bad example, since out
of example is wrought not merely the impulse toward
imitation, but often a passionate realization of the advantage
of “another way.”</p>

<p>There was always in the Mar house one person with an
eye upon the clock—why need you wear a watch?</p>

<p>No need for you to spur on a servant, or make example
of a tardy errand boy. There was always Mrs. Mar to do
these things with a swingeing efficacy. Those who live
with the Mrs. Mars of the world do not realize that they
owe their own reputation for sweetness largely to the
caustic temper of some one else. Under Mrs. Mar’s roof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
you may “cultivate kindness” and not suffer for it.
Away from her drastic influence, you yourself will have
to apportion grace and discipline more evenly.</p>

<p>So various is life that we have sometimes a chance of
learning from people’s vices what their virtues could
never so deeply have impressed.</p>

<p>Something of this the “slow” girl arrived at.</p>

<p>The day Mrs. Mar and Hildegarde went off to spend a
week down at the ranch with the Waynes, the two came
into the dining-room to say good-by to Mr. Mar. It was
to be “a house-party,” and Cheviot and Mr. Mar had
been asked, too. Cheviot had accepted—“from Saturday
night till Monday morning”—but Mar had declined
to go for any length of time whatever.</p>

<p>“A body would think he had affairs too important to
leave! Well, good-by, Nathaniel. Don’t let hot cinders
fall on the new hearth-rug. Take care of yourself,
and I <em>hope</em> you’ll have some news for me when I come
home.”</p>

<p>Upon their return the following week, he was found
sitting in exactly the same place, in the precise attitude,
and one might almost think with the same old book on his
knee open at the self-same page.</p>

<p>“Upon my soul!” ejaculated Mrs. Mar, stopping short
on the threshold, while Hildegarde went forward to kiss
her father. “No need to ask if you’ve found anything
to do! You haven’t even remembered to put on a little
coal.” She fell upon the poker and punished the flagging
fire. “Have you been sitting there like that ever
since I went away?”</p>

<p>Mar drew himself out from Hildegarde’s embrace, took
firm hold on his walking-stick and rose to his feet. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
looked huge, as he towered above the two women, and
rather wonderful, as both of them had often thought of
late. Even the flippant Bella had said, “He’s more and
more like Moses and the Prophets.”</p>

<p>“As to sitting here”—he looked down sternly on his
wife—“you may as well understand, Harriet, that this
is the house I propose to sit in till I go out lying down.
Only not in this room. I agree with you as to the unfitness
of that.” He limped over to the kitchen door,
opened it, and said, “John, will you light a fire in the
young gentlemen’s bedroom.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar stared a moment, and then went up-stairs to
take off her things. It was no secret between her and
Hildegarde that “after all” they stood a little in awe of
the head of the house. The girl, however, knowing herself
a privileged character, attempted to smooth things
over with a little jest. She linked her arm in his, and
told how her mother, on the way down in the train, had
produced the book rest and a minute pencil from her
traveling-bag, had fastened the rest on the back of the
seat in front of her, to the surprise and inconvenience of
the occupants, had set up the French biography, put on
her spectacles, got out her crochet and read her “Lucien
Pérey” and crocheted for dear life (or for the Hindus
rather) every minute of the time that she was being
rushed along by the express to Fern Lea; “and Louis
Cheviot leaned over and whispered in my ear, ‘Your
mother’s losing time with her feet.’”</p>

<p>But Mar’s faint smile was pretty grim. “Your mother
has all the virtues, my dear, but she’s a woman of an
implacable industry.”</p>

<p>With the help of John Chinaman and the grocer’s boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
that very afternoon Mr. Mar got his big desk established
in “the spare chamber” that had been Trenn’s and
Harry’s room, and still was theirs when one or other of
them was in town,—which was often enough whenever
Bella was staying at the Mars’.</p>

<p>But whether it was that uncomfortable as the old quarters
had been, it disturbed Mar to change them after
thirty years, certainly, in spite of his pronouncement to
his wife, he did not “sit” at home as much after this.
He made a habit of going down town after breakfast, to
the San Joaquin Hotel “to read the papers,” really to
smoke in peace, and exchange views on the political situation,
or the Cuban atrocities, with chance travelers or
old habitués.</p>

<p>Then came the day when Spanish incompetence and
cruelty found a rival excitement. In a remote region of
British North America gold had been discovered. The
veterans in the San Joaquin reading-room pooh-poohed
the notion—all but Nathaniel Mar.</p>

<p>From the beginning he took the Klondike seriously.
Not long before everybody was doing the same. Instead
of quickly exhausting itself the excitement grew. Had
diamonds been discovered in Dakota, the matter would
have been a nine days’ wonder, and then died as the
easily accessible fields were reached and appropriated.
Paradox as it might appear, it was owing to the forbidding
circumstances under which those pioneers of ’97
found their treasure, that made the appeal “Klondike”
so irresistible to the marvel-loving fancy of the world.
The papers overflowed with accounts of the awful hardship
and the huge reward—combination irresistible since
history began. And if any Missourian said “show me!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
he <em>was</em> shown. The actual nuggets and the veritable
dust, displayed in a bank window, made would-be miners
of men as they passed, or as they meant to pass and stood
riveted, staring, seeing there a type of what they might
attain unto, if only they had much courage and a little
money for an outfit. Who lacked the first? Who could
not, for so alluring a purpose, collect the second?</p>

<p>The trains to the ports of San Francisco, Seattle, Victoria,
were crammed; the north-bound ships overflowed.
Unenterprising, indeed, any store on the Pacific coast
that did not advertise some essential to a Klondike outfit.
People talked with as much earnestness of the science of
life under arctic conditions as they before had discussed
Spanish misrule in the South. Even for the vast majority
who had no hope of being able to join the rush,
the great problem of transportation and the value of
evaporated food stuffs, obscured many an issue nearer
home.</p>

<p>The one man that he was on fairly intimate terms with,
yet to whom Mar had not mentioned the new craze, was
Cheviot. It was the kind of thing he would be certain to
scoff at. People at the San Joaquin had noticed that
scoffing at the Klondike annoyed Mr. Mar, and they wondered
a little. Mar had quite made up his mind not to
give Cheviot’s skepticism a chance for expression. If
you were unwary you might easily think, “So sympathetic
and understanding a young man can’t help taking
fire over this burning question.” And then Cheviot
would show you how easily he could help it. Watch him
playing with his little nephews and nieces and you’d
say, “So kind to children, he will be kind to the childishness
in me.” And behold he wasn’t. He was an “awfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
good fellow,” but he expected a man to be grown
up—and few are.</p>

<p>Mar’s anticipation of what would be Cheviot’s views
about the new craze were very much Hildegarde’s own.
Her astonishment was therefore well-nigh speechless,
when, on the occasion of his next visit, after ten minutes’
general conversation in the garden, Cheviot said, “By
the way, Hildegarde, I’ve come to tell you I’m going to
the Klondike.”</p>

<p>“You!” and she stared at him in silence till she could
reassure herself by saying, “Nonsense!”</p>

<p>“It may be nonsense, but I’m going.”</p>

<p>“You <em>can’t</em> be in earnest!”</p>

<p>“Quite.”</p>

<p>She stood, watering-pot in hand, her big eyes wider
than ever he had seen them, and a look on her face certainly
disturbed, even annoyed.</p>

<p>It wasn’t very nice, this feeling as if the bottom were
dropping out of existence. He had no right to make her
feel like that.</p>

<p>Very neatly he switched off the head of a withered
flower with his stick, and began, “The Klondike—”</p>

<p>“It’s rather horrid of you,” Hildegarde interrupted,
“but of course I know—you—you’re only seeing how
I’d take it—”</p>

<p>“I shan’t be here to see how you’ll take it.”</p>

<p>She set down the watering can. “You surely won’t
dream of doing anything so foolish—so—so—dangerous.”</p>

<p>He didn’t answer, and she walked beside him down
the path to the lower gate. When they got beyond the
group of conifers, she stopped. “You simply mustn’t.”</p>

<p>“Why do you say that? You don’t care where I go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“You know quite well I do.”</p>

<p>He didn’t even look at her, and he shook his head.
Then, after a little pause, “Who knows, you might even
come to feel differently about things—if—if—”</p>

<p>“Do you mean”—Hildegarde drew herself up—“if
you came home a millionaire?”</p>

<p>“If I didn’t come home at all.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“At least for a long time, like—”</p>

<p>“I certainly hope”—nervously she forestalled the
utterance of that other name—“that you won’t do anything
so disappointing to all your old friends. It’s the
kind of fortune-hunting expedition for the ne’er-do-well.
It isn’t for a man like you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve thought it over,” he said, “and I’ve
come to the conclusion that I’m best out of Valdivia for
a time. You see, Hildegarde, you’re too used to me.”</p>

<p>“I’m <em>not</em> ‘too used.’”</p>

<p>“Too certain of me—yes, you are. I’ve been uncommon
helpless in the matter. I’ve got nothing of the
actor in me. I can’t be near you, and inspire you with
the smallest doubt as to how things are with me. The
one thing I can do is <em>not</em> to be near. And that’s what
I’m going to do.”</p>

<p>She wrinkled up her white forehead with a harassed
attempt to keep her wits about her, and not be betrayed
into rash professions. “You can go away from Valdivia
for a while, if that idea is so attractive, without going to
the horrible Klondike.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I could go to Pasadena or some seaside resort,
so that I could come running back, as I did last year
from Monterey, on the first hint that you might be missing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
me a little. No, all that’s been tried. It doesn’t
work. I must go to some place where I <em>can’t</em> take the
first train back; where I won’t live through the day expecting
a letter from you. It isn’t easy in these times
for anybody to be really ‘out of reach.’ When we all
know that we’ve only to go to the nearest telegraph
office for news, we can’t know what it would be like utterly
to lose some one—unless death teaches us. The
nearest approach to the sort of thing I mean—this side
of Kingdom Come—is the Klondike.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Klondike, Klondike! I’m sick of the very
sound of those two syllables. There’s something uncanny
about them. People have gone mad since they
heard the ugly word, but not you!”—to give her words
more than common emphasis, to insure winning the day,
she laid her hand on his arm, and said again, with soft
deliberation—“Not you, Louis.”</p>

<p>“You’d like me to stay here and suffer. Yes, I know
that.” Her hand dropped from his sleeve. “But I
shan’t stay here,” he went on unmoved, “and pretty
soon I shan’t suffer—so much.”</p>

<p>From that old, recurrent touch of hardness in his voice
and air, she once again recoiled. “Well, I’ve said all I
mean to say. You must please yourself.”</p>

<p>“Pleasure is of course what one expects in the Klondike.”</p>

<p>They walked in absolute silence back to the porch.
Hildegarde went in at once, saying “good-night” over
her shoulder, and quite sure that as usual he would follow
her. But he stayed behind for fully twenty minutes,
talking with Mr. Mar, who was smoking out there in the
dusk. Hildegarde turned up the electric light in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
parlor, and moved about the room, picking up and putting
down one book after another. How many of them
he had given her—that provoking person who stayed so
long talking to her father! By and by she heard her
own name called. Was that her father? How curious
his voice sounded!</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, but made no great haste. When
at last she reached her father’s side, she couldn’t see
where Cheviot was. She looked round in the dim light,
and a little sharply, “Has he gone?” she said. As the
words fell on the quiet air, she heard the gate shut. The
sound jarred. It gave her a sensation as of a being abandoned.
The house was very quiet to-night.</p>

<p>“Gone? Yes. Where’s your mother, Hildegarde?”
Mar asked with unheard-of briskness.</p>

<p>“She’s over at the Coxes’.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” A moment’s pause, and then, “To think of
Cheviot! Cheviot of all men! Weren’t you surprised?”</p>

<p>“You aren’t talking about the Klondike?”</p>

<p>“What else should I be talking of?” he demanded unreasonably,
for after all there were other topics.</p>

<p>“Do you think he really means it?” Hildegarde asked.</p>

<p>“<em>Means</em> it?—with a year’s leave granted, and his
ticket in his pocket? He’s been getting ready all this
week. That’s why we haven’t seen him. Sails Wednesday.”</p>

<p>“Not—not really!”</p>

<p>“Off to ’Frisco to-morrow,” said her father, still in
that odd brisk voice—“four days to see about his outfit.
He—it’s a queer world!—he said Trenn had been into
the bank this afternoon, and offered to grubstake him.
But Cheviot’s got money. So anything he finds will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
his own. Trenn! H’m! <em>Trenn!</em>” he repeated, as
though he couldn’t get over it. Then it seemed to dawn
upon him that Hildegarde had been unprepared for
something else than her brother’s part in the affair. “I
thought Cheviot said he’d been talking to you about it—had
said good-by.”</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t believe he was in earnest.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded her father a little harshly,
and then, perceiving that her incredulity might have
other grounds than disapproval of the enterprise in itself,
he said more gently: “He talks very sensibly about
it, my dear. A man can’t save much at the bank—he
may go on for thirty years and find—Cheviot has seen
what that may come to. He gives himself a nine months’
holiday, with the chance of its turning out the most
profitable nine months of his life. <em>I</em> didn’t discourage
him.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde sat down on the step. “Oh, you didn’t
discourage him,” she repeated dully. Behind her own
sense of being wronged in some way, as well as disappointed,
she was conscious of an unwonted excitement in
her father.</p>

<p>He, sitting there in the dusk, puffing out great clouds
of smoke, was oblivious of everything except that the old
pride of discovery had awaked in him, and the fever of
his youth came back.</p>

<p>“Even Cheviot! And think of <em>Trenn</em>!” That Trenn
should be looking about for some one to send to the North
on this errand—it touched the topmost pinnacle of the
fabulous. And yet, why not? The country was aflame.
Thousands starting off on an uncertainty to try for the
thing he, Nathaniel Mar, had been certain of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hildegarde, where is your mother?”</p>

<p>“I told you, at the Coxes’.”</p>

<p>“Oh, at the Coxes’.”</p>

<p>“Why, father?”</p>

<p>“Would you like to know the reason I didn’t discourage
Cheviot from going to the—”</p>

<p>“Yes, father,” said the girl dully.</p>

<p>“Then come nearer.”</p>

<p>She moved toward him. Feeling a little dreary, she
came quite close. She laid her head against the one
strong knee.</p>

<p>In a vigorous undertone, the voice with new life in it
told why Nathaniel Mar didn’t blame any young man—there
was more treasure in the North than even the Klondiker
dreamed. Mar had known it all along—and then
the story. In spite of the girl’s listlessness when he began,
he could feel directly that the thing was taking hold
of her. She was intensely still; that was because she was
being “held,” and small wonder! It was a better story
than he had realized. It took hold of him even, who
knew it so well. Before he got to the end, his voice was
shaking, and he leaned forward thirsting to see an answering
excitement in the young face at his knee. But
the darkness shrouded it, and he went on. He wished
she would speak or move. Always so still, that girl!
Now he was telling her of his home-coming from that
barren coast in the North—explaining, excusing what,
by this new lurid light of the Klondike, seemed inexcusable—his
never going back. He tried to reconstruct for
her the obstacles—huge, insurmountable; the long illness,
and the new wife; the post at the bank; the children,
poverty, skepticism and the obscuring dust of the years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
And lo! as he disturbed these ashes, he saw afresh the
agonies they hid—remembered with a growing chill,
what had befallen before whenever he told this story;
saw the tolerant smile of the smug young bankers; saw
the dull embarrassment in Elihu Cox’s eye; heard Mrs.
Mar leading the family chorus, “You’ve got to <em>show</em> me!”</p>

<p>Even Hildegarde might ask—he hastened to forestall
the dreaded word. “There was nothing to <em>show</em>,” he
said, “absolutely nothing to prove it wasn’t a dream.”
And she made no sign that for her either it was more
than fantasy.</p>

<p>He wondered miserably why he had told her. “Of
course it was all long before anybody had heard of the
Klondike,” he said, and he drew a heavy breath. “The
theory was, that geologically speaking, gold couldn’t
exist up there, and even people who weren’t geologists
agreed it couldn’t be got out if it <em>was</em> there”—all the
confidential earnestness had vanished out of the voice,
and he paused like one very weary. “Nobody believed—”
He tried to go on, and to speak as usual, but
memory, master of the show, brought up Trenn—Trenn
with the look he had worn the day his father had told
him the great secret. Mar drew back into the deeper
shadow. But the critical boy face found his father out,
and stung him in the dark.</p>

<p>He was an old fool. What had possessed him to rake
it all up again. Oh, yes, he said bitterly in his heart,
there was one member of his family who hadn’t yet
smiled and said, “<em>Show me.</em> I’m from Missouri.” It
was Hildegarde’s turn.</p>

<p>“Well, my girl,” he ended miserably, “that’s the
story that nobody believed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Hildegarde lifted her head and put up her two hands,
feeling in the dark for his. But Mar shrank back. Not
from Hildegarde herself could he in that hour take mere
sympathy, craving hopelessly as he did with the long
thirst of years a thing more precious than pity—the
thing that he once had had and had no more.</p>

<p>Like a man who utters his own epitaph, “I lost faith
myself,” he said.</p>

<p>“But I have found it, father!” and there was joy as
well as the sound of tears in the thrilling young voice.</p>

<p>“Found—what did you say, Hildegarde?”</p>

<p>“That I believe the gold’s there, waiting!”</p>

<p>“Ah—h—h!” He bent over her with a sound that
was almost a sob. “Then I—I believe it, too!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-l.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Louis Cheviot was one of those who
reached the Klondike in the autumn of ’97.</p>

<p>A lucky chance brought him the opportunity
of going shares in a lay on Bonanza,
with a man whose fitness for “pardnership”
Cheviot had tested coming over the awful Pass and
shooting the Hootalinqua Rapids.</p>

<p>The two had washed out ten thousand dollars apiece
by the end of June. They had the prospect of making
an even better thing of it the next year. Cheviot left his
partner to carry on the development of the lease, and
for himself, turned his bronzed face homeward.</p>

<p>He was as certain now as before he had garnered this
experience that for wild life, <i lang="la">qua</i> wild life, he had no
taste. That it should be so was partly, strange as it may
sound, a result of the cool and balanced mixing of the
elements in him. He had no physical sluggishness to be
sloughed off by harsh impacts, no mental inertia to
be hammered into action by hard necessity, no crust of
chrysalis that must be broken before the winged life
might emerge, no essential wildness of spirit that needed
training, no excess of ungoverned ardor that needed
cooling in the northern frosts.</p>

<p>And so it was that he was coming home with little
gain but bullion, since he had gone forth with smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
need than most of the lesson learnt in chastening the
body, or the lightening revelation of some crashing
danger.</p>

<p>He could endure hardship with reasonable patience
for some reasonable end, but the gains of civilization
were in his eyes too excellent to be even temporarily
abandoned without a sense of heavy deprivation, which
affected him like a loss of common dignity.</p>

<p>Even though he hadn’t one he loved the idea of home.
He loved his friends and all the friendlier aspect of the
earth, gardens, ordered communities of his kind, and
all man’s device for socializing life and regulating the
unruliness of nature.</p>

<p>And there was Hildegarde—who had not answered
either of his two letters. Why was that? He felt a contraction
of the heart as he refused to allow himself to
formulate surmise; yet if any one had come and said to
him, “Galbraith’s in Valdivia,” he would have felt it
no surprise.</p>

<p>Some friends of his were going out by the Yukon River
route. He knew it to be unlikely that he should return to
this part of the world. As well see that more western aspect
of it, too, since he might do so in congenial company.</p>

<p>It was really the company that decided him—that was
responsible for a circumstance that changed the entire
course of his own and several other lives. Instead of
going back as he had come, by the shorter way, he found
himself, at the end of July, with seventeen hundred miles
of river behind him waiting at the mouth of the Yukon
for the San Francisco steamer.</p>

<p>He heard with surprise that there was a letter for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
at the post-office. The more strange, if true, since his
coming to St. Michaels was less than mere chance—it had
been unlikely in the extreme.</p>

<p>However, upon demand, an envelop appeared in the
window of the little post-office. Before ever it reached
the hand of the man waiting without, he recognized Hildegarde’s
writing. He tore it open to read a hurried
resumé of what she said she had already written him at
length, to Dyea and to Dawson, and now repeated, on the
bare possibility of his taking the American route home.
For her father was just setting out by that same route
to the far North, and by the same ship that carried her
letter. His plan of campaign was not generally known,
and all she could say with certainty was that he would
be at St. Michaels some time in August. And she greatly
hoped that if Cheviot should be passing that way, or
even if he found that he could arrange to go there without
too great personal cost, Hildegarde hoped, and even
begged, that he would look out for her father. She
“quite approved,” Cheviot read with incredulous eyes—(Hildegarde!
who had thought the expedition mad for a
man young and sound as an oak)—she quite approved
her father’s going. At the same time she did not forget
that he was no longer young, and being so lame was at a
disadvantage. “Good Lord! I should say so!” The upshot
was that she “lived upon the hope” that Cheviot
would bring her news of Mr. Mar. The ideal thing would
be that they should come home together. If Cheviot
brought that about she would be “unendingly grateful.”</p>

<p>No syllable about Galbraith.</p>

<p>Cheviot went straight to the Alaska Commercial Company’s
hotel and looked through the names registered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
since the season opened. Not a Mar among them. So
the ship that brought the letter had not brought Mr. Mar—for
this was the only conceivable place he could have
stayed in. It was no small personal relief to Cheviot to
conclude that wiser counsels had prevailed.</p>

<p>The same afternoon it was noised about the office that
a steamer had just been sighted. After all, Mar might
only be delayed! While most of the population rushed
down to the beach, Cheviot scribbled a hasty note and
handed it to the clerk.</p>

<p>“If a man of that name should come in on this ship—”
he began.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t gone back yet,” interrupted the clerk,
studying the superscription.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean he’s here already?”</p>

<p>“Well, he <em>was</em>.”</p>

<p>“When? It can’t be the person I mean?”</p>

<p>“Lame man, about sixty? Yes, yes, remember him
perfectly. Couldn’t quite make him out, for he didn’t
seem to care a tinker’s curse about getting to the Klondike.
The boys set him down finally as a sort of a missionary,
because” (with a laugh) “he seemed so ready to
go the wrong way.”</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“Up the coast to Golovin Bay.” No, he hadn’t come
back. A trader from Kwimkuk, who had been down for
supplies, said Mar was staying up there at the Swedish
Mission. That was all the clerk knew. He was turning
the pages back to the entries of the previous summer.
“That’s the man!” And there was Mar’s unmistakable
signature staring Cheviot in the face.</p>

<p>“But that’s ’97,” he said bewildered. He pulled out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Hildegarde’s letter, and looked again at the date. It
was a year old.</p>

<p>Shortie Hinkson stopped sweeping out the office to say:
“One o’ them missionary fellers come down here from
Golovin Sat’day. No, he ain’t gone back yit. I seen
him only a while ago goin’ by the A.C. office.”</p>

<p>When a few minutes later, among the crowd down by
the old Block House, the missionary was run to earth,
Cheviot found him a great tow-headed Swede, looking as
if he had been not so much cut out of wood as hacked
out, and with a very dull implement at that. Close at
his elbow, and appealed to now and then for verification
of some statement, was a thin little dark man, with glittering
black eyes and a turn for silence.</p>

<p>The tall missionary was bargaining about some “canned
stuff” with the great A.C. Company’s agent, Captain
Seilberg. This magnate, leaning against one of the
mounted cannon the Russians had left behind in ’67, was
looking through a spy-glass at the ship discernible on
the far horizon, while between ejaculatory oaths he “did
business” with the rugged Lutheran. Waiting for a
chance to introduce himself, Cheviot wondered aside to
a bystander why those two talked English to each other.</p>

<p>“Oh, Seilberg’s a Norwegian.”</p>

<p>“No, a Dane,” put in another, overhearing.</p>

<p>“I thought,” said Cheviot, “they could all understand
one another after a fashion—all Scandinavians.”</p>

<p>“Scanda who? Well, anyway, they’re too thick on the
ground in Alaska for us to bother about fine distinctions.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the customs officer, as Cheviot pressed
forward to speak to the missionary, “so far as we’re
concerned they’re all Scandahoojians together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Certainly Mr. Christianson knew Mr. Mar. Mr. Mar
was still at the Mission House up at Kwimkuk. How to
get there? The big missionary turned to his silent companion,
who still stood gloomily by. Mr. Björk and he
wouldn’t mind taking back a passenger in their boat.
They were going just as soon as they’d settled matters
with Captain Seilberg.</p>

<p>“Vell, <em>I</em> von’t keep you,” says the great man cavalierly,
shutting up the spy-glass with a snap. “Dat’s
not de <i>Trush</i>, Got dammer!” and he turned testily away.
Mr. Christianson followed with words about rebate on
“damaged cans.” Mr. Björk followed Mr. Christianson,
deaf to Cheviot’s questions about Mar, eyes fixed in
abstraction on the red-brown scoriæ under foot.</p>

<p class="tb">The two “Scandahoojians” and their passenger left St.
Michaels the next day in the little sail-boat <i>St. Olaf</i>,
managed with no small skill by Mr. Björk. It was the
rugged Christianson, however, who issued the orders, and
strangely enough, considering his aspect, supplied the
social element and the information. If you saw Christianson
alone, you would have thought him one of the
grimmest works of God, but seeing him beside Björk
you would find him almost genial.</p>

<p>What chiefly occupied Cheviot, as the <i>St. Olaf</i> sped
through the windy drizzle, was a growing wonder as to
how Hildegarde’s father had come to be stranded up
here all these months, and how a man accustomed to
creature comforts, a cripple, and close on sixty—how
had he endured the conditions of life at “Golovin!”
What <em>were</em> the conditions at Golovin? Curious to know,
for Hildegarde would ask—afraid to know, for Hildegarde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
must be answered, he kept seeing in flashes and
as through the eyes of a girl, all the probable harshness
of the old man’s adventure.</p>

<p>Cheviot’s questions about Golovin were interrupted
by Mr. Christianson somewhat narrowly—eliciting an
account of how the mission prospered; what the native
population was; how many were converts; and
other matters not strictly to the point Cheviot had in
mind.</p>

<p>“Yes, <em>oh</em>, yes! Dere is great acti-<em>vitty</em>. You can
see in our reports. Ve make great progress. Ve bring
de true light to many who sat in darkness. But ve arre
poore—meezerabble poore. Nobody knows, what haf
not lief dere, how harrd de life. Eh, Björk?”</p>

<p>Björk, sheet in hand, gloomily assented, without the
aid of speech.</p>

<p>Cheviot caught his glancing eye. “Are you—a—a—at
the mission, too?”</p>

<p>The dark man studied the course and held on his silent
way.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Mr. Björk ees von of os. He is not long
dere—but he understand. Ve haf great need of vorkers.
So he come.”</p>

<p>“You mean you sent home for Mr. Björk?”</p>

<p>Mr. Christianson stared a moment. “Send home? Oh,
it is far to Sveden. Heaven is nearer.”</p>

<p>It was Cheviot’s turn for mystification.</p>

<p>“Vhen ve need helpers,” Mr. Christianson explained,
“ve pray for dem. God send os Mr. Björk.”</p>

<p>He spoke with a curious matter-of-factness.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Cheviot, “and—a—how did Mr. Björk
know where to find you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“He see Kwimkuk in a visshun. He see de Mission
House and he see me, too. Eh, Björk.”</p>

<p>The helper nodded with preternatural gravity.</p>

<p>“Where were you,” said Cheviot, “when you had the
vision?”</p>

<p>“On board a whaler. Dat’s where Björk was,”
proudly Christianson answered for him. “On de whaler
up in Grantley Harbor, vhile I am down dere at Kwimkuk
praying for help.”</p>

<p>“But how could he leave his ship?”</p>

<p>“Leedle boat,” said Christianson, laconic for once.</p>

<p>“Oh, the captain let him off?”</p>

<p>Christianson shook his pale locks. “You do not know
vhat dey are—dose whaling captains.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean”—in his astonishment Cheviot addressed
the dumb navigator again, as if given such a
theme even he must at last find tongue—“you don’t
mean you,” and then he halted, for there is something
about the impact of the word “deserted” that men shy
from, “you don’t mean you left the ship without
leave?” Björk’s face never changed.</p>

<p>But not so Christianson’s. He regarded his acolyte
with a somber enthusiasm. “It was yoost like Björk.
Say noddind. Yoost follow de call. Dat’s Björk!”</p>

<p>“Pretty big risk, I should have thought.”</p>

<p>At which, somewhat to Cheviot’s surprise, Björk gave
a sharp little nod and Christianson showed his long yellow
teeth in a rather horrible smile.</p>

<p>Cheviot felt egged on to say, “Don’t they shoot deserters
up here?”</p>

<p>“<em>Yes!</em>” said Björk, speaking for the first time.</p>

<p>“If dey find dem,” amended Christianson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Björk’s little eyes glittered. His thin lips moved
faintly, as if they, too, would have smiled had they ever
learned the trick of it.</p>

<p>“And you came straight to Kwimkuk?” persisted
Cheviot.</p>

<p>“No, he land oop by Sinook,” Christianson said.
“He see dat not de place he vas shown in de visshun, and
dose whaler fellows after him de next day. Björk hide
in de scrub villow, and creep along vid hands and knees.
After two days he come to a native camp. Next morning
he see out dere dat <i>Seagull</i> comin’. But he haf anodder
visshun. He know now he haf to get a squaw to
hide him in de bottom ob a kyak, and take him like dat
down de coast to Golovin. Terrible long journey! I
am down dere on de shore, when de squaw beach de boat.
I see Björk crawl out de hole in de middle, half dead,
and look round. Look all round. Den I hear him say in
Svedish, ‘Dis de place!’ and I say, ‘Vad Plads?’ leedle
surprised, and he come right away up to me, and he say
‘De Lord sent me.’ So I see he vas de man I pray for.”</p>

<p>“Oh! And when he isn’t managing a boat—up at
the mission, what does Mr. Björk do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he help,” said Christianson, with unshakable satisfaction
in the answer to his prayer. “Better as anybody
he can preach.”</p>

<p>“<em>Preach?</em>” echoed Cheviot, not believing his ears.</p>

<p>“Yes, Björk not talk <em>mooch</em>, except vhen he is in de
pulpit or vhen he haf a refelation.”</p>

<p>Well, they were odd Hausgenossen for Hildegarde’s
father! “How long had Mr. Mar been with them,” Cheviot
asked. Ten or eleven months. He had got to St.
Michaels too late last year to reach the Klondike. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
just had time to go and take a look at Golovin Bay,
when the winter overtook him at Kwimkuk. So he
stayed there.</p>

<p>But this summer? Well, he was taken ill just about
the time the ice went out of the bay—no, no, he was all
right now. Mrs. Christianson had nursed him. Christianson
didn’t know what Mar’s plans were—doubted if
anybody did; though he was laying in supplies for some
sort of excursion. He once had an idea of going all the
way to Teller Station to see the Government reindeer.
That was Mar’s stuff, there, in the boat. Of course it was
little use now to go to the Klondike. Besides, what incentive
had a man of that age to face the hardships of
prospecting in the arctic? It was no matter if such a
man had not great fortune. He wouldn’t know how to
use it. He had not, Mr. Christianson was sorry to say it,
but Mr. Mar had not the true light.</p>

<p>From which Cheviot gathered that Mr. Mar had not
contributed all he might to the cause of Righteousness.
But it was a relief to know that he had not been in
straits. “He seem to haf blenty to bay his bills”—so
why had he come up there, caring neither for money
nor for missions? Here Cheviot caught the momentary
gleam in Björk’s little eyes. A question in them, but
unspoken, like all else that went on in the close-cropped
bullet head. Cheviot became aware that his old friend
had somehow succeeded in making himself an object of
intense curiosity to these queer folk.</p>

<p>They liked Mr. Mar, though—Christianson tried to
catch Björk’s eye, but the dark one declined confederacy—though
Mr. Mar had done something a little while ago
that made a great deal of trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hein? Veil, it vas like dis. Von of our great deeficoolty
is de vitchcraftiness of de natives. Not a season
go by vidout dey have to tie up some von.” He pursed
his wrinkled lips and slowly shook his colorless locks.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Cheviot, feeling his way. “How long do
they keep them tied up?”</p>

<p>“Till dey confesses, or till dey dies.”</p>

<p>There was need then of the missionary in this savage
place, where Hildegarde’s father had had to spend a year
of his life.</p>

<p>“And if they confess, it’s all right, is it?” asked Cheviot.</p>

<p>“If dey confess, and if dey go and get a piece of de
fur, or vhatever it is, dat dey’ve cut off de clo’es of de
person dey been vitching, and if dey give it back, and
promise ‘never again.’”</p>

<p>“And then they’re forgiven?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Sometimes dey’re stoned, sometimes dey’re
yoost spit at and den let to vander avay—but dey’re
forgiven.”</p>

<p>“Oh, like that? Well, I wonder they trouble to confess.”</p>

<p>“Dey like it better dan to be dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead?”</p>

<p>“Burnt.”</p>

<p>“Really? They went as far as that? But now, you
mission people, I suppose, have put a stop to such goings
on!”</p>

<p>“Ve are not greater at Kwimkuk dan Saul at Endor.”</p>

<p>Cheviot stared.</p>

<p>“But Mr. Mar,” the missionary went on, “he vill be
viser dan de Prophets. He tink dere are no more any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
vitches. Not even vhen he see dat Yakutat girl dey call
Omilik—not even vhen he see vhat she have done. But
von day Mr. Mar hear some noise, and he go down to de
beach, and he see de girl tied to de tall stone ve fastens
our boats to. He see dey been beating her, and now dey
pile up de driftwood round, and he, not understanding”—the
missionary explained, with an air of forbearance—“he,
not understanding, he try to interfere. Dey very
mad of course. Dey send for me. I tell Mr. Mar I
<em>know</em> dis girl have vitched a baby and two men. De
vomen all know it—everybody but Mr. Mar know it quite
vell. Mr. Mar get very excited and say he not believe it.
Dey bring de baby; he say, ‘Dat a sick baby, anyhow.’
He not understand at all. Dey go on vid making de fire.
Mr. Mar yoost goin’ to do someting foolish, vhen de girl
cry out, ‘I confess. Yes, yes, I do all dem tings!’ ‘Dere,
you <em>see</em>!’ I tell Mr. Mar. So dey make de vitch go and
bring de little pieces vhat she cut off de baby coat, and
off de men’s clo’es for to vitch dem vid. Dey all holla
vhen dey see dose tings. All but Mr. Mar. He say de
natives dey all done dat; dey all steals pieces off everybody
in the settlemint; cause dey so ’fraid anybody get
sick, dey be called vitches; and if dey not got any pieces
to give up, dey know dey shall be burnt. ‘So dey all
keeps plenty ’gainst de evil day,’ says Mr. Mar.</p>

<p>“He mek so great foos, I tell dem yoost to tie de girl
so she not wriggle out, and leave her dere like dey done
Chuchuk last year. So dey does dat. Ve all goes avay.</p>

<p>“Von day and night. Two day and night. Tree
day and night. Dat girl yoost de same. Dey cooms to
me and says, ‘Somebody gif dat vitch to eat.’ I say
nobody vill do a ting like dat. Dey say dey sure. Next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
night dey vatch. Dey see Mr. Mar go down vid bread
and vater. You can tink dey are mad. It is good I am
dere. I say, ‘Vait! I vill talk vid Mr. Mar.’ I do dat.”</p>

<p>His faded white-lashed eyes grew sterner still as he
recalled the interview.</p>

<p>“Well, what happened?”</p>

<p>“It vas for me a moment of great responsibeeleetee.
De more ve talk, de more I see it ees for Mr. Mar a matter
of sentiment. <em>No</em>! of <em>nairves</em>! For os it ees a matter
of religion. Ve live vid dose people. Ve teach dem. Ve
feed dem in time of famine. Ve nurse dem ven dey are
sick. But ven dey do vat the Yakutat voman haf
done—”</p>

<p>His low, booming voice went out across the surf, leaving
behind a trail of menace like the deadened roll of a
distant gun.</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>Cheviot’s eyes were held by the fiery look on the
rugged face. Impossible to doubt the burning sincerity
that gave its ugliness that moment of almost uncanny
power.</p>

<p>“Mr. Mar see it no good to say dere is no more any
vitches vid dat Yakutat voman at our door. So he say
ve shall not be crool even to a vitch. Den I tell him, ‘A
man also or a voman dat haf a familiar spirit or dat is a
vizard shall surely be put to death; dey shall stone dem
vid stones; dere blood shall be upon dem. For all dat
do dese tings are an abomination unto de Lord.’”</p>

<p>After a silence, “What did he say to that?” Cheviot
asked.</p>

<p>“Hein—hn—hn!” Christianson shook back the
square cut hanks of tow that fell from under his hat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
“Not even Mr. Mar,” he said, with an air of triumph,
“not even Mr. Mar talk back to Moses!”</p>

<p>But the good man’s satisfaction seemed short-lived.
He was grave enough as he went on, “Big storm in de
night. Next day no vitch dere.” He waved a great
bony hand toward Kamchatka.</p>

<p>“Vitch gone off vid de vind.”</p>

<p>Then, lowering his voice as though out there in the sea
hollows listeners might be lurking, he bent forward: “If
dey vas to know Mr. Mar go down in de storm, and cut
de raw hide for let dat vitch go!—” Again, with grim
foreboding, he shook the hanks of tow.</p>

<p>“Ve all like your friend, but ve sorry see any yentleman
tink he know better as de Bible.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-c.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Cheviot found Hildegarde’s father practically
a prisoner.</p>

<p>His board and lodging had been too welcome
a source of revenue to the mission for
Christianson to feel called upon to smooth the
way for his departure, and Mar had been some time in
grasping the fact that his plan of hiring a boat and a
couple of natives to go up the coast for a “look at the
country,” was hopelessly knocked on the head since his
interference in the matter of the Yakutat witch. Not
a native in the community who felt safe with him since
that episode. The lame man was in league with the
powers of darkness.</p>

<p>Mar’s pleasure at seeing Cheviot was genuine, but not
as unmeasured as you might expect. And when, almost
before the first shower of questions and answers had begun
to abate, Cheviot flung in information as to when the
next ship was leaving St. Michaels, Mar assumed the
subject to be of interest only to Cheviot. Pressed further
about his own plans, the elder man said evasively they
were not very settled, and changed the subject! Cheviot
was nonplussed. Was Mar only waiting till they were
clear of the Mission House? No, for they were out fishing
the whole of the next day, and most of the days
following, and still Mar talked of any and everything
save of going home. Was he waiting for funds? Surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
not now that Cheviot was at hand. He seemed inexplicably
satisfied to sit all day over a trout pool up the
river (despite the pestilential mosquito), or in a boat
in the bay fishing for tom-cod; and all the evening playing
chess in the bare mission parlor, in the midst of a
company sufficiently singular. Shady fellows from the
Galena camp above White mountain; prospectors expelled
from Cook’s Inlet, lousy, filthy-smelling natives
come upon one pretext or another, weird missionaries
dropped down from places no man but themselves seemed
ever to have heard of; a reindeer-herder in the Government
service, though a “Scandahoojian,” like the majority
at the Golovin Mission, and highly welcome albeit
hardly on the score of his piety. For “Hjalmar,” as
Christianson called him, was the one who jibed most at
the morning and evening prayers, and particularly at
the long grace before meat, with its delicate proposals to
the Almighty that He should induce those present to save
their souls by giving to the Golovin Mission. With the
same breath that thanked Him for “dis dy bounty,”
the Omnipotent was reminded that if this agreeable state
of things was to continue, people must pay not only for
the meal, but for the Cause.</p>

<p>Mar listened, or didn’t listen, with an air of respectful
quiescence, and ate his meals unabashed. But he
commiserated Cheviot, “How this must make you long
for your Valdivia luxuries. Well, when do you go
back?”</p>

<p>“Whenever you’re ready.”</p>

<p>Mar showed as little gratitude as pleasure.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t think of waiting for me,” he answered
shortly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Cheviot was profoundly perplexed as to what he ought
to do. Mar was not a man that any one could comfortably
catechize, but to go away and leave him here with
public opinion so against him; for Cheviot to present
himself to Hildegarde, knowing he had left her father
on this inhospitable shore, to all intents and purposes a
prisoner—it was not to be thought of.</p>

<p>Mar’s favorite scheme for a good day’s fishing was to
row across to the river mouth where some Englishmen,
several years before, had made a camp.</p>

<p>In the sheltered hollow a little way up the stream they
had built a cabin, so well, that although long deserted it
still offered refuge from the drenching rain, or from the
unshut eye of the sun, and even from the greater torment
of mosquitoes. For Mar had learnt the value of the Esquimau
use of a “smudge.” On the way to the cabin
he would gather two handfuls of arctic moss, of straw
and some aromatic smelling herb, twist all together in
two wisps and set one alight on the flat stone that
formed the threshold and the other smoldering in a rusty
pan upon the sill of the single window, with the result
that the mosquitoes fled. In great comfort Mar and
Cheviot would proceed to make tea, and eat their sandwiches—at
least, Cheviot ate his. He noticed that although
his friend never disposed of a third of what he
brought, he did not the next time bring any less. Quite
suddenly one day it dawned upon Cheviot why. For
although the crackers and cheese and sandwiches that
were left were always carefully put away in a tin
cracker-box, the box on their return was invariably
empty.</p>

<p>And Mar never seemed the least surprised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Was it that he could not bring himself to abandon the
poor wretch he had rescued; could that be at the root of
his delay? But why did he not take Cheviot into his confidence
and get the girl out of the country if she were in
hiding hereabouts? Was it conceivable that Mar—</p>

<p>Cheviot got little further in his speculations till the
morning when Mar, in the act of making a cast, said
under his breath and without moving a muscle, “There’s
that fellow again!”</p>

<p>Cheviot turned just in time to see Björk’s head disappear
behind a bunch of tall reeds that grew in the hollow
by the little fresh water stream below the cabin.
“What’s he lurking about like that for?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’s on the track of a poor, wretched
girl,” and Mar told the story of the Yakutat witch, but
with additions not creditable to Mr. Björk.</p>

<p>“It’s usually an old woman, here as elsewhere, that’s
accused and set upon, but this girl can’t be above seventeen,
for she hadn’t been long out of the Bride’s House.”</p>

<p>“The what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the horrible igloo where they confine the marriageable
girls for half a year. They stay in there, in the
dark all that time, never seeing the face of man; and
they come out cowed, and fat, and pallid; and then they’re
for sale as wives. Those that no man takes are looked
down upon, and left to shift for themselves and must
earn their own living. The Yakutat girl was pounced
on instantly by a man she hated for some reason. He
took her off, but she escaped and made her way to the
mission. Nobody was at home at the time but Björk and
me. I saw her come in, and I saw her come flying out
of the mission parlor wilder even than she’d entered it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and go tearing down to the village. She found shelter
there, for a while, with the woman who had brought her
up. But public opinion was all against her; and when
it was found that the reason her ‘husband,’ Peddykowchee,
didn’t come and get her, was that he was ill,
they said she had bewitched him. His younger brother
said she’d done the same to him, and then a miserable
little baby—oh, it was a ghastly business. ’Sh—” and
Mar fished in silence for a full hour, with occasional
sharp glances through the alder thicket behind him,
down among the reeds by the deserted cabin.</p>

<p>The next day the store left in the cracker-box was
found to be untouched.</p>

<p>“She’s seen Björk!” said Mar under his breath.
“She’s afraid to come any more.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you help her to get out of the country?”
Cheviot asked, setting alight the smudge on the window-sill.</p>

<p>“I was planning that when you came, but I don’t want
to mix you up in any such ticklish business.”</p>

<p>“It’s no more ticklish for me than for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m blown upon already. The people here have
been red hot about it. They haven’t cooled down yet.”</p>

<p>“They never will,” said Cheviot.</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Mar, “but I’ve made the cause mine,
you see. After you’re gone—”</p>

<p>“I’m not going till you do.”</p>

<p>“That’s nonsense.”</p>

<p>“If you like,” said Cheviot.</p>

<p>“It’s on account of that letter of Hildegarde’s?”</p>

<p>“Whatever the reason is, I’m going to stay if you are,
and you may as well let me in for my share of the fun.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your ‘share!’” repeated Mar reflectively, and
stroked his long gray mustache.</p>

<p>“I was arranging to get the girl away,” he went on
presently, “when you came. I had bought this boat and
made a habit of being out all day.”</p>

<p>“Exactly! All we need is provisions.”</p>

<p>“No, I sent Christianson to St. Michaels for provisions.
They’re at the mission now.”</p>

<p>“Of course, we brought them up with us! Then we’ve
nothing to do but to get the stuff into the boat.”</p>

<p>“Without exciting suspicion.”</p>

<p>“And pick the girl up somewhere on the coast.”</p>

<p>“—before they realize we’re gone for good.”</p>

<p>“Surely you and I could start off on an excursion together
without exciting suspicion. Why, you told them
when you first came, you were going up the coast, ‘to
have a look at the country,’” he added, remembering
Christianson’s phrase.</p>

<p>Mar studied him an instant with uncommon intentness.</p>

<p>“What is it?” laughed Cheviot. “You look as if you
couldn’t make up your mind to trust me.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m making up my mind I will.” Again he
paused for a moment, and then, “I am too old to do the
thing alone,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, I can manage the boat, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the girl can row as well as a man, but I must
have a partner.” And sitting there in the deserted
cabin Nathaniel Mar, for the last time, told how a hundred
and odd miles further up the coast he had panned
out gold with a dead man’s help when he himself was
young.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>And when he had said it, that thing befell him that
overtook any enthusiast in talking to Louis Cheviot.
Mar saw his story on a sudden in a comic light. Clear
now, its relationship to twenty “tall stories,” fit matter
for a twitch of the humorous lip, a hitch of the judicial
shoulder.</p>

<p>The unconscious Cheviot had choked off many a confidence
just by that look of cool amusement.</p>

<p>“I’ve always said,” Mar wound up, preparing hastily
to withdraw again into his shell, “I’ve always said it
would ‘keep,’ and it <em>has</em> kept close on thirty years.”</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t keep much longer,” said Cheviot
briskly.</p>

<p>“Why not?” A tremor shot through the man with the
secret.</p>

<p>“Why? Because it’s in the air.”</p>

<p>Mar clasped and unclasped his big walking-stick as if
about to rise.</p>

<p>“Before another year,” Cheviot went on, “the whole
of Alaska will swarm with prospectors.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Why, it’s begun. I don’t believe there’s a
single Yukon tributary where there isn’t a man wandering
about this minute with a shovel and a pan.”</p>

<p>“The Yukon! Well, that’s a good way to the south!”</p>

<p>“Those men that stopped at the mission last night—they
were miners.”</p>

<p>“They—they were after galena!” said Mar, almost
angrily. “They knew that fairly good ore had been
brought down Fish River off and on since ’81.”</p>

<p>Cheviot laughed. “Well, if you imagine they won’t
so much as look for gold, let’s smuggle your witch to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
St. Michaels and take the first steamer home. <em>I’ve</em> had
enough of the North.”</p>

<p>“You say that because you don’t really believe I’ve
discovered a second Klondike.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I believe it? And haven’t I turned
my back on the Klondike we all know exists?”</p>

<p>“Those men that came to the mission yesterday,” Mar
said hurriedly, “they—they were going to Fish River,
weren’t they? Not—not up the coast?”</p>

<p>“No, no, that’s all right,” Cheviot reassured him.
“All I meant was that somebody hereabouts had only to
whisper ‘Gold!’ for this whole country to swarm.”</p>

<p>“I know—I know. But we’ll have the start, Cheviot.”</p>

<p>Mar pulled himself up by the aid of his stick, and
dragged the rude soap box table out of its shady corner,
into the light nearer the window, a light but little obscured
by the faint smoke wreaths that curled about the
pan and sent abroad a slightly pungent breath, agreeably
acrid, except to the summer pest. Mar’s excitement
found little expression in his face, but, so to speak, came
out at his finger tips. He could hardly hold the piece
of paper he had pulled from his pocket. Up to ten
minutes ago he had felt almost as far from his ancient
purpose as though he still sat on the high stool in the
inner room of the Valdivia bank. Now, and within the
last few seconds more especially, fulfilment seemed
breathlessly near. Sitting on one side of the soap box,
with Cheviot opposite, Mar traced on the back of an
envelop the land-locked inner Bay of Golovin, the outer
bay, and from Rocky Point a broken line on up the coast.</p>

<p>“This,” he said, shading a little strip bordering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
shore, “this is the sand-spit where I found the Esquimau
camp. Here’s the crooked river, with its mouth full of
wood. Only six or seven miles to the north is the anvil-shaped
mountain.”</p>

<p>The two men, bending low over the soiled envelop,
were too absorbed to notice the glitter just above the window-sill;
eyes narrowed to evade the smoke; two mere
points of light to the right of the rusty pan with its haze
of smoldering incense.</p>

<p>Mar’s pencil whispered over the paper in the silence.</p>

<p>Then he spoke. “From this broken range on the north
three or four streams come trickling down to the coast.
The one on the west here winds round from the north
side of the Anvil, and it was just at this point, as I remember—just
here,” and the pencil shook as if in doubt,
or refusing to commit itself, till Mar planted the point so
firmly on the paper it made a dent as well as a mark.
“<em>Just here I found the gold.</em>”</p>

<p>When finally Cheviot raised his eyes the glitter was
gone from the sill.</p>

<p class="tb">While the two in the cabin laid their plans and made a
list of provisions and requirements, a man was creeping
on hands and knees, through willow scrub and reeds,
down to the boat that lay moored in the cove below the
cabin.</p>

<p>Christianson sat talking to Hjalmar the herder, of the
Government project of introducing reindeer among the
Alaskan natives, when the door of the private office was
flung wide. They looked round and saw Björk standing
there.</p>

<p>On the sallow mask a strange light shining. The hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
lips twitched in a recurrent rictus, showing a dog-like
gleam of sharp eye-tooth, while the rest of the mouth
held rigid. If the tremendous force that locked the lean
jaws was lost upon the onlooker, it must have been the
insane light in Björk’s eyes that made the reindeer-herder
whisper, “He’s got a fit.”</p>

<p>But Christianson had only flung back his long, straight
hair, and grasped the rude arms of his big chair.</p>

<p>“Björk,” he said, “iss it a visshun?”</p>

<p>“Ye—h—h!” Björk answered through shut teeth.
An instant longer he stood silent, with his hairy hands
clenched, and a barely perceptible forward and backward
swaying of the tense body. Then, with an effort as
of forcing steel to part, he opened his welded lips and
said rapidly in Swedish, “Have we not fed the hungry?”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Christianson.</p>

<p>“Have we not nursed the sick? Have we not preached
the Gospel to every creature?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye,” from Christianson.</p>

<p>“Have we not kept the law?” With each question
nearer and nearer Björk brought the black menace of his
face.</p>

<p>“Have we not had the faith that moveth mountains?
Have we not served in hardship? Have we not waited in
poverty till this hour?”</p>

<p>“<em>Till</em> this hour?” said Christianson, getting up slowly
out of his chair.</p>

<p>Björk arrested his own dreamlike advance with a suddenness
that seemed to wake him. He stopped, looked
round, and clutched at the back of a chair.</p>

<p>“Shut the door,” he commanded.</p>

<p>His chief obeyed. When Christianson turned round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
again, Björk was staring over the reindeer-herder’s head,
piercing the infinite depths of space, while he held tight
to every-day existence by the back of a chair.</p>

<p>“Brethren,” he said, “the angel of the Lord has been
with me. He has shown me great riches.”</p>

<p>Hjalmar the herder pulled himself together and shook
off his growing nervousness. There was nothing uncanny
in this after all. A vision of riches was only too common
since the Klondike had crazed men’s brains. Björk saw
that even Christianson looked less moved.</p>

<p>“I tell you,” the seer burst out, “this is the answer to
all our prayer, the reward of all our work. The angel
took me westward up the coast. I see it now!” He unlocked
his clutching hands, raised them outstretched on
a level with his eyes and with hypnotic slowness moved
the right hand east, the left one west.</p>

<p>“A sand-spit,” he said, “where the heathen gather.
Beyond—a flat country, where no tree grows. But the
river mouth is choked with sea-drift. A strange shaped
hill. One of old Thor’s workshops. Where <em>he</em> hammered
the sword of the gods, <em>we</em> shall forge weapons
against the ungodly. Weapons of gold. For the river of
that country—the angel showed me the sands of it! And
the sands, Christianson, the sands were full of gold!”</p>

<p>The herder looked at Christianson and Christianson
looked at the herder. The herder shook his head.</p>

<p>Christianson sat down again in his great chair.</p>

<p>“I tell you,” said Björk solemnly, “I see that ‘promised
land’ plainer than ever I saw Kwimkuk. Plainer”—he
raised his voice—“than I see you two.”</p>

<p>But he saw them very plainly. His look leaped from
one face to the other, and rage gathered on his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“You sit there like stone. You are deaf. You are like
dead men. I—I—” He looked about the room wildly
as if he had forgotten where the door was. “I would go
alone, but I must have provisions. I must have help
with the boat—help with the—”</p>

<p>“Y—yes, yes,” stuttered the old missionary.</p>

<p>“And the angel said, ‘Go first to Christianson.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. Of course, I—”</p>

<p>“‘But tarry not,’ said the voice. ‘If Christianson receive
not the good tidings, go take the news to another.’”
He seemed now to locate the door. He made two steps in
that direction, saying, “Me—I obey the voice.”</p>

<p>“I, too, obey,” said Christianson hurriedly. “I will
come Saturday.”</p>

<p>“<em>Saturday!</em>” Björk’s burning impatience blew the
end of the week to the end of the world. “I tell you <em>to-morrow</em>
will be too late! It must be to-day. It must be
this hour.”</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded the herder, but he, too, was on his
feet.</p>

<p>“Ha! You will ask questions! No wonder the angel
comes to me.” Again he turned about and rushed at the
door. Christianson intercepted him. Björk, with a convulsive
movement, flung him off.</p>

<p>“The voice said, ‘This is the hour you have prayed for,
but if it passes in idleness, pray no more—<em>pray no
more</em>!’” Björk’s voice rang out with a tragic authority.
“‘For this is the hour when your feet should be shod
with swiftness and your hands be full of cunning.’ It
was the voice said so.” Björk’s fingers were on the
latch. “Me—I obey.” He opened the door.</p>

<p>“Come, Hjalmar,” said Christianson.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-h.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Hildegarde’s sense of anxious responsibility
had grown with every month that
passed after her father sailed out of San
Francisco harbor. Bound for—“the Klondike!”
people exclaimed with envy, rather
than asked in any doubt.</p>

<p>“No—no,” he had said, and then hastily—to keep outsiders
off the track—“well, perhaps. Who knows?”
Who <em>didn’t</em> know! And, after all, why should any man
stay at home who wasn’t obliged?</p>

<p>It was natural that no one else should take Mr. Mar’s
enterprise as seriously from the start as did his daughter.
For she knew how large had been her share in it. She
had been the first, the only one, to cheer him on. She it
was who had got “the boys” to finance the undertaking.
She who had broken the fact to her mother. But for his
daughter, Nathaniel Mar would not now be—where was
he? How faring? Many a time Hildegarde’s heart contracted
sharply, as in silence she framed the question.
Her own fault that she couldn’t answer—her fault that
half Valdivia could no longer set their clocks by the big,
lame man’s passing—her doing that he sat no more of a
morning in the warm, sunny room of the San Joaquin,
sending out smoke and absorbing news. Others sat there
in peace and safety, discussing their absent townsman;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and Hildegarde sat at home trying to keep at bay the
thought: if anything dreadful should happen to him!</p>

<p>It had eased her a little to write to Cheviot, and beg
him to look out for her father. She was tempted to say,
“Bring him back safe and there’s nothing I won’t gladly
do to prove—” But she had pulled herself up in time,
and only promised an unending gratitude.</p>

<p>The steamer <i>President</i>, which had taken Mar north,
brought on her return trip a brief letter from him, saying
merely that the journey was safely accomplished as
far as St. Michaels. His family knew they would probably
not hear again till the following summer.</p>

<p>Life was easier when Bella was there. To her one
might say, “Will he come back by the first boat in June,
or shall we only have letters, do you think?” And say
it in one form or another so often that, but for reasons
unavowed, the speculation would have wearied friendship.</p>

<p>But Bella was full of sympathy and tonic suggestion,
always prepared to pore over northern maps, always
ready to discuss probable conditions “up there.”</p>

<p>What a friend was Bella! “I’ve <em>talked</em> of a standard,”
Hildegarde thought humbly, “but she lives up to
it—in these days.” It was a shame ever to remember the
lapses long ago.</p>

<p>And how intelligent she was! How curiously well
informed! But Bella was always surprising you.</p>

<p>“I keep thinking about him in the night. I lie awake
wondering if he’s cold,” Hildegarde confessed, and
Bella, why, to look at her face you’d think she knew all
about that lying awake and wondering—did the same
herself. “Father does so love a fire. Don’t you remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
when all of us would be baking he used to draw closer
to the hearth?”</p>

<p>“That was only because he lived so much indoors.
He’ll be <em>quite</em> warm in that beautiful furry sleeping-bag.
He’ll probably sleep better than he’s done since
he was a child. They all do.”</p>

<p>“Who do?”</p>

<p>“Oh—a—people who—go to the Klondike.”</p>

<p>Another time, “I am haunted by the certainty that he
didn’t take enough provisions. Trenn says that in intense
cold people eat a great deal more than—”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said Bella sagely, “but it’ll be all
right. People are very good to one another in such out-of-the-way
places. They always share with anybody who
runs short.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what the accounts all say.”</p>

<p>“What accounts?”</p>

<p>“Oh, in the—the papers.”</p>

<p>“I never see any such accounts. It’s all horrors—freezing
and starving to death. Besides, father will be
the one to do the sharing and then have to go without.
Oh, <em>why</em> did I help him to—”</p>

<p>“Don’t be absurd,” Bella said, almost angrily. “In
any case <em>he’s</em> not gone beyond the reach of supply depots.”
Neither met the other’s eye.</p>

<p>“But suppose his money gives out—it will give out if
it’s true they charge two dollars for a potato. He never
could keep any money in his pockets. Oh, it’s all very
well for you, <em>your</em> father isn’t sitting on an iceberg
starving to death.”</p>

<p>A queer look came into Bella’s little face. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
there, now and then, and gone like a ghost, leaving a
troubled tenderness behind.</p>

<p>“It’s not as if he were near a settlement, as the Klondikers
are to Dawson City,” Hildegarde went on, yearning
for reassurance. “The place father was going to is
quite uninhabited, except by a few Esquimaux. Often I
can hardly eat for thinking—thinking”—her voice
caught—“maybe he is hungry.”</p>

<p>“That’s impossible. He’s much too sensible and
clever.”</p>

<p>“What good is it to be sensible and clever if you’ve
got nothing to eat?”</p>

<p>“But being sensible and clever will help him to find
things to eat.”</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?”</p>

<p>“Oh, as far south as that—”</p>

<p>As far <em>south</em>? Was she out of her mind?</p>

<p>“There are plenty of ptarmigan and rabbits and
things, where Mr. Mar is.”</p>

<p>“Are there? But he’s lame. How can he go shooting—”</p>

<p>“Other people can, especially the natives, and you may
be sure your father will have his share. Besides, he’ll
fish. Mr. Mar’ll like that part of it.”</p>

<p>“How <em>can</em> you be so heartless!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“How is my father to fish in rivers frozen hard as
iron?”</p>

<p>“Through holes in the ice, of course!” Bella defended
the idea warmly. “You’ll see,” she spoke as if
she’d personally tested the efficacy of the device;
“you’ll see they’ll get fish all winter that way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“How <em>do</em> you know? Now don’t say you get it out of
the newspapers, for I never see these things, and I look
for nothing else.”</p>

<p>“No, I found that in a book.”</p>

<p>“What book?”</p>

<p>It turned out to be a two-year-old volume upon Arctic
Exploration. On the fly-leaf Bella’s name and the date,
1896. A whole year before Cheviot went to the Klondike,
or Mr. Mar to Alaska. The year that—</p>

<p>The light that had glimmered broke in a flood.</p>

<p>“Let us read it together, Bella,” said Hildegarde
softly.</p>

<p>“No, there’s a newer one I’ve just sent for. We’ll
read that if you like.”</p>

<p>They finished it at the Waynes’ country place. “I
wish,” said Hildegarde, “we had another book about—”</p>

<p>“There are plenty more.” Bella unlocked a little
chest. It was full of nothing but books, and the books
were about nothing but arctic life and exploration. For
nearly two years, Bella had been buying and reading
everything she could hear of published on the subject in
America or Europe.</p>

<p>Hildegarde hung above the store. “We must go
through them all together. It is the most fascinating
reading in the world.”</p>

<p>“It is the most horrible in the world. The most
ghastly, it makes you ill. But, yes; I agree with you one
can’t <em>not know</em>.”</p>

<p>They read the books together. Even the honest-hearted
Hildegarde, who began with her father agonizingly
present in her mind, abandoned him presently to his
probably less terrible fate, and pushed forward with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
strange men on their farther journey; fitting each new
fortune or mischance to the One on the other side of the
world, never mentioned either by her or Bella. Though
Hildegarde kept her oath not to speak Galbraith’s name,
she felt a strange new excitement now in saying “He”
as for her father, yet thinking of the One who had gone
farther afield even than Cheviot, and much, much farther
than Mr. Mar. Each girl played with the ruse. It gave
to reading and speculation a subtilty—a spirit—that
never flagged.</p>

<p>And now spring was here. Although still far too
early for such forecasting, both felt the need of returning
to Valdivia, to be within easier reach of papers, of
telegrams, and of returning travelers. For all the
world knew when once the spring was come up yonder,
the summer followed hard. How natural it was to be
looking forward to something great and wonderful that
was to happen in June! Hildegarde and her father had
done that as long ago as when the girl was in her early
teens and Jack Galbraith expected back from his first
arctic enterprise. What more natural than that Hildegarde
and Bella should be doing very much the same
to-day. To call their expectation by Mar’s name, merely
gave it manageability. For, apart from Bella’s interdiction,
the word “Galbraith” was, in this, like a hot
iron. If it were to be touched in safety, some shield
must come between you and the too ardent metal. “Galbraith”
would scorch. But wrap “Mar” about the forbidden
name, and you could use it to significant ends.</p>

<p>Summer and Mr. Mar! Oh, Mr. Mar served well as
symbol of that mightier issue, that both dared hope for
out of this year’s opening of the ice gates of the North.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet the month of wonder, June, went by without
a word or a sign coming down from the top of the world.</p>

<p>July brought a letter from the Klondike—Cheviot’s
second. He had done well, and he was coming home.
Hildegarde might look to see him by the next boat. No
word of Mar; plain he hadn’t had Hildegarde’s news
when he wrote. Not the next boat, however, nor the
next, brought Cheviot, nor any word of Mr. Mar.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how I should get through this time
but for you, Bella.” Hildegarde and she were seldom
apart.</p>

<p>Not till mid-August came the sign from Mar, a letter
written from a queer-sounding place in early June, a
letter strangely short and non-committal. He had
reached St. Michaels too late the previous autumn to go
any further than Golovin Bay, before navigation closed.
He would push on as soon as travel was practicable.
He was well. He sent his love. And no more that summer.
No more up to the time the boats stopped running
in the autumn.</p>

<p>Cheviot had not come after all. And silence, like the
silence of the grave, wrapt the fate of that Other, on the
far side of the world.</p>

<p>“I shall burn a joss to those who travel by land or by
sea, by snow or by ice,” said Bella, one day in December,
and she lit the stick of incense on the flower altar,
whence no heathen smoke of prayer had risen for a
couple of years now. But more prayers than ever before
had been offered up in the little white room. And what
need of a face on the wall above the roses? The picture
was not really shut away in a drawer. Vivid in each
girl’s mind, it was borne about as faithfully, as in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
old days, when on Hildegarde’s breast in a setting of
silver it hung on a velvet string.</p>

<p>Now and then Bella remembered Cheviot, and when
she remembered him, she spoke of him. Sometimes she
spoke of him when she was thinking of him little enough.
As on the night when she wasn’t well, and Hildegarde,
sleeping on the sofa in her friend’s room, had waked in
misery over a dream she’d had. Bella was lying wide-eyed
in the dark, “A dream about—?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Hildegarde said hurriedly, “a snow-storm in
the night, in the wind; a slipping down into blackness.
I thought I saw him fall, and I knew it was the end.”</p>

<p>“They go by contraries. Your father’s quite well
and happy.” Hildegarde had not said the dream concerned
her father, but she offered no correction.</p>

<p>“Still,” Bella went on, “for the moment it makes one
feel—I’ll tell you! we must have a little light to
comfort us.”</p>

<p>“No, no; it will hurt my eyes,” Hildegarde was surreptitiously
crying. But Bella was already up, and before
Hildegarde could forestall her, she had opened the
door across the hall leading into the opposite room, and
there she was striking a light. Hildegarde followed her,
still a little dazed by the vivid horror of the dream, and
when her eyes fell upon her own little white bed, she
flung herself down there, and buried her face in the cool
pillow.</p>

<p>“You aren’t crying, are you, Hildegarde, over a silly
dream? Look here, I’m lighting a joss for Mr. Mar.”</p>

<p>A little silence.</p>

<p>“I’ve lit another,” said Bella’s hurried voice, still
over there by the table, “one for Louis.” Hildegarde,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
with face half-hidden, imagined rather than saw, that
three slender smoke feathers were curling above the
flowers, drowning the meeker fragrance of the roses.</p>

<p>She lay there feeling the oppression of the dream fading,
and a waking oppression take its place. Yes, they
“went by contraries.” Galbraith hadn’t fallen and
been swallowed in the gaping maw of a crevasse; but
when he came back, what was going to happen? He
belonged to Bella. But he had left Bella. And he had
belonged first of all to Hildegarde. What would befall
friendship in that coming wrench!</p>

<p>“Go back to bed, Bella; you’ll be worse.”</p>

<p>“You must come, too.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde made no answer.</p>

<p>“You can’t lie there with all these flowers in the
room. I didn’t know you hadn’t set them out. The
doors can’t be left open either.”</p>

<p>“The windows can.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t go unless you come, too.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde forced herself to get up. Bella put out
the comforting light. But some things show plainer in
the dark. Those symbols on the altar, they were only
tendrils of smoke by day, or in the glare of gas. Now
they were sparks of fire puncturing the blackness of the
scented room. One fiery eye to watch over the fortunes
of Nathaniel Mar, one to shine for Cheviot, and an unnamed
third to pierce the darkness that shrouded the
fate of that Other. Even when the two girls turned
their backs, and groped their way to Bella’s room clinging
hold of each other in the dark, the third spark not
only shone before their inner vision still, it pricked each
bosom with its point of fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>What would happen when he came back?</p>

<p>Each wondered, and each held faster to the other
with fear in the bottom of her heart.</p>

<p class="tb">Meanwhile, life outwardly went on pretty much the
same. With Trenn and Harry, Eddie Cox and other
swains, the girls went to parties and picnics, to concerts,
and the theater, and did all the usual things. The one
unusual thing those days brought was the Charles Trennor
fancy ball. It was going to be a great affair, and
Valdivia conversation for weeks had begun by some
such statement as, “I’m going as the Goddess of Liberty.
What shall you be?”</p>

<p>Of course Trenn and Harry were coming up for the
great occasion, and their costumes called for endless consultation
with that great authority, Bella. They had,
moreover, told their sister she might on this occasion be
as glorious as ever she liked, and they would “foot the
bill.” Hildegarde deeply appreciated such generosity,
but what was more to the point, did Bella?</p>

<p>She only said: “Yes, Hildegarde’s going to be
glorious. But I don’t think it’s the kind of glory you
can buy.”</p>

<p>Even before the Mar boys had come forward in this
magnificent way, Bella had decided that Hildegarde
must go as Brunhild. Her gown was to be white cloth,
embroidered with silver dragons—strictly adapted from
an ancient Norse design. She was to wear silver sandals
on her feet; on one bare arm would be a buckler, a spear
in her right hand, and on her fair hair a silver helmet.</p>

<p>Bella was going as Amy Robsart, and that was easy
enough. It was those dragons of Hildegarde’s that took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the time; and, as Bella had said, they wouldn’t have
been easy to buy. She and Hildegarde were embroidering
them every spare minute, day and night. Even
now, though almost, they were not quite done, which
was a pity. Trenn and Harry were coming up from
Siegel’s again this evening—the excuse, the necessary
inspection of Brunhild, at Bella’s express invitation.
For this had been the one costume not ready in time for
the “dress-rehearsal” two nights before, when Bella and
“the boys” had put on their Elizabethan finery, and
peacocked about in great spirits.</p>

<p>“I want your brothers to be what they call ‘knocked
silly’ when they first see you, Hildegarde. You must
be all dressed and ready, and we can turn up the bottom
of the skirt and work at that last dragon while we’re
waiting.”</p>

<p>In pursuance of this plan, the two girls had gone up-stairs
directly after supper, though it was hardly probable
the boys could get there before half-past nine.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar sat waiting for them in the parlor, on that
side of the center table where the book rest supported
an open volume. She rocked while she waited, and she
crocheted while she rocked. At times she glanced at the
clock—not once at the open book. Not for her own
edification was the volume there, but for the enlargement
of Hildegarde’s literary horizon, while she and
Bella stitched at silver dragons. But this latest choice
in standard works had not pleased any one. Victor
Hugo was much too fond of fiery love-scenes to prosper
with Mrs. Mar, but the miserable man had become a
classic, and after all, Hildegarde was old enough not to
be infected. Bella—she read everything, the minx!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Although Hildegarde was in her twenty-fifth year, Mrs.
Mar knew her so little, she felt no assurance that the
girl would keep up her languages, or read “the best
things” in any tongue, without her mother’s dragging
her by main force across the flowery fields of belles
lettres—as though over stubble and through brake.</p>

<p>Listening to Mrs. Mar’s reading of a classic was an
experience of some singularity. For if she macerated
descriptive bits with a chin-chopper despatch, to get
them out of the way (not disguising the fact that she
considered these passages in the light of the salutary
self-torture that no disciplined life should evade, any
more than vaccination or a visit to the dentist), she did
far deadlier things to scenes of sentiment or passion.
These she approached with a sturdy determination not
to give in to their nonsense, to make them at all events
<em>sound</em> like sanity by sheer force of her own impregnable
common-sense—a force so little to be withstood, that it
could purge the most poetic page ever written. It made
even Victor Hugo sound as reasonable as the washing
list. If you didn’t inwardly curse or secretly weep,
you must have laughed to see how effectually she could
clip fancy’s wings, slam the door on sentiment, bring
high passion down to a sneaking shame, and effectually
punish a great reputation. In short, listening to Mrs.
Mar reading romance was so sure a way, not only to
strip it bare of its traditional glory, but to rob it of
every chance of “going home,” that Hildegarde, as soon
as she got wind of what was the next work to be attacked,
hastened to borrow it of Bella, devoured it alone,
and so got a first impression that could more or less hold
its own against the maternal onslaught. It is but fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to say that to any comedy passage Mrs. Mar gave excellent
effect, and, by way of appreciation, a grim smile
peculiarly her own; while for a spirited encounter between
wits sharp and merciless, she had open approval.</p>

<p>“That’s something like!” she would say. “Old
Dumas” (or whoever it might be), “he can do it when
he likes!” and the great one was patted on the back:
“<em>This</em> man’s going to live.”</p>

<p>Bella had known that Mrs. Mar would sit in the half-light
till even she could see no longer. But Hildegarde
was not suffered to make her entrance in the dusk. Bella
ran in first and “lit up.” She did not stop to draw the
blinds, she was in too great a hurry; besides, it was nice
to let in the mild and beautiful night. “Now, Hildegarde!
Look, Mrs. Mar,” and Bella ushered in a living
page from an old Icelandic Saga; “isn’t she glorious?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar pecked at the regal figure with her hard,
bright eyes, “White doesn’t make her any slimmer,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, it wouldn’t do for Brunhild to be a mean,
little, narrow creature.”</p>

<p>“That helmet, too! It makes her look ten feet high.”</p>

<p>“She wants to look high!—<em>and</em> ‘mighty!’ and she
does. No, no, stop Hildegarde, you <em>mustn’t</em> take it
off.”</p>

<p>“Just till we hear the boys coming. It—it’s—”
Hildegarde contracted her broad brows under the helmet’s
weight.</p>

<p>But Bella flew to the rescue. “Don’t, don’t! Hands
off! What does it matter if it <em>is</em> heavy? You must get
used to it. You’ve got to be a heroine!” she wound up
severely, “so don’t expect to be comfortable!” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Bella pulled a chair under the drop-light. “Sit here
where Trenn and Harry can see you the minute they
open the door. Now we can go on with the last dragon
while we’re waiting.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar cleared her throat, “‘Acte Cinquième. La
Noce.’” And the two girls, raising their eyes from
the work, saw through the open window, in front of
them, not the close-massed syringa underneath, nor the
soft Californian night above, but “une terrasse du palais
d’Aragon,” in the town of Saragossa, four hundred
years ago. And no sense visited them of any jarring
contrast between the picture of the world in the yellow-backed
book, and the picture of life as they knew it best.
Thanks to the poet that lives in most young hearts, even
Victor Hugo’s gallant vision of a civilization that was
old before California was discovered, brought no envious
sense of the difference between then and now—rather
a naïve surprise that those others so far away, so long
ago, should have understood so well.</p>

<p>Older, more self-critical, they might have lost this
sense of comradeship—might have gone over to the gray
majority that insists only the past is picturesque, or that
if any grace remains unto this day, it must needs be far
removed from places we know well, precariously surviving
under other skies, speaking an alien tongue.
Those who would persuade us there is no scene in our
every-day life but what is sordid, barren, or at best
(and worst) meanly commonplace—stuff unfit for poetry
or even for noble feeling—what do the carpers by such
comment on our times but confess an intellect abject,
slavish, blind. To find the beauty and the dignity that
lie in the difficult familiar days that we ourselves are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
battling through, to detect high courage in the common
speech, to get glimpses of the deathless face of romance
as we go about the common streets, is merely to know
life as it is, and yet to walk the modern world as gloriously
companioned as any Viking or Hidalgo of the past.</p>

<p>So true is early youth’s apprehension of these things,
that not even Mrs. Mar could make wide enough for
envy or embarrassment the gulf in the two girls’ minds
between an Old World bandit chief, and a New World
soldier of fortune. The transition, that to the sophisticated
seems grotesque, between the Hernani of 1519
and the modern American pursuing perilous ways to the
Pole—this feat was accomplished without misgiving, although
in Saragossa, “on entend des fanfares éloignées,”
and in Valdivia an indefatigable woman, on the other
side of the street, was strumming the old tune, renamed,
“The Boulanger March”; and now Mrs. Mar was beginning
Scene III with an air of cold distrust, that Bella
foresaw would mount by well-known degrees to a climax
of scorn.</p>

<p>The lady turned the page.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">Brûle—Eh! dis au volcan qu’il étouffe sa flamme,’—</div>

<p>“How long are they going on like this, I wonder?” she
interrupted herself to durchblätter the pages.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘Ah! qui n’oublierait tout à cette voix celeste!’”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And more fingering of the leaves. “Four more solid
pages of this sort of thing,” she announced. “Well, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the rest of the world has stood it, I suppose we must.”
And she went on—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘Ta parole est un chant où rien d’humain ne reste—’”</div>
</div>

<p>Bella dropped the silver dragon, and with, “Wait,
Mrs. Mar, <em>dearest</em> Mrs. Mar!” she seized the book.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p>“This is <em>my</em> part!” said Bella, shutting the volume
convulsively. “I know it every bit.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Hildegarde, with tears, put out her hand and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Bella’s. No word, just the clasp of hands, till they fell
apart to work.</p>

<p>“H’m,” said Mrs. Mar dryly. “I suppose you’ve
seen Sarah Bernhardt go on like that.”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no. I don’t like Sarah in this. I do it much
better.”</p>

<p>“A good many people seem to be able to put up with
the other lady.”</p>

<p>But Bella, smiling, shook her head, as she drew a new
strand of silver thread through her needle. “I don’t
like seeing her make dear Doña Sol so—so snaky, and so
wildly unnatural.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you think Doña Sol’s <em>natural</em>—”</p>

<p>Bella laughed. “You’d think she was nature itself
compared to Sarah.”</p>

<p>“People said the same thing about Curly what’s-his-name.”</p>

<p>“Curly?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the Englishman who acted with the red-haired
woman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean Kyrle—”</p>

<p>“Curl! Is that how he calls himself? Well, I’m
sure I’ve no objection. I liked him. But people went
about saying <em>he</em> wasn’t natural.”</p>

<p>Bella looked up. “Did you think he was?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. But I’m a person who likes <em>acting</em>.
I don’t want them natural.” She wound up in a tone
of delicious contempt, “I can see people being natural
every day of my life, without paying for it.”</p>

<p>Bella laughed. “Oh, I’m <em>so</em> glad I know you, dear
Mrs. Mar!” That lady, unmoved by the tribute, began
to do her duty by the notes. Bella never listened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
notes, and by and by her little face took on again the
tragic look with which she had declaimed, “La fatalité
s’accomplit.”</p>

<p>Bella was a good deal changed in this last year. Hildegarde,
looking at her paling beauty, was sometimes
stricken with fear. “What should I do without her!”</p>

<p>The postman’s ring. Bella jumped up without ceremony
in the middle of Note 2, and ran out to see what
had come. Only a paper. It wasn’t the postman.
Merely the little boy outrageously late with “The Evening
News.”</p>

<p>Bella returned to her dragon—Mrs. Mar read on.</p>

<p>After all, who could be sure but what that paper lying
there—how did Bella know but it had a Norwegian
telegram in it, saying word had come of the rescue in the
arctic of a party of Russians under an American leader?
Or no, the leader had done the rescuing—against awful
odds. Not Bella alone, but two entire continents were
celebrating his name. For this was the intrepid explorer
of whom nothing had been heard for nearly four years—who
had been given up for dead, by all but Bella
Wayne.</p>

<p>And this man—oh, it made the heart beat—this man
had discovered the Pole. That was why he’d been so
long away. It took four years to discover the Pole. But
it was done. The whole civilized world was ringing with
his name. And natural enough. It was the greatest
achievement since Columbus’ own, and the hero’s name
was—</p>

<p>No, no, it wouldn’t be like that at all. He would
want Bella to be the first to know. The next ring at the
door would be a telegram for her. Or no, he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
hardly want to break so long a silence in that brusque
way. No, he would write her a beautiful long letter—telling
her—explaining— No! Far more like him just
to appear. Without writing—without telegraphing.
Just take the swiftest steamer across the Atlantic, and
the fastest train across the Continent, and some evening
like this, she, little thinking it the hour that should bring
such grace, she would lift up her eyes and there he
would be!—standing before her. Not only without a
long explanatory letter, without words, her face would
be hidden in his breast.</p>

<p>“There!” Mrs. Mar interrupted an alternative soliloquy
of Don Carlos, and Bella started. “They’re early!
There are the boys, now!”</p>

<p>“I don’t hear them.” But as Hildegarde spoke the
words she was conscious of steps on the graveled path,
that wound its rather foolish way round this side of the
house, leading nowhere. No one ever walked there but
Hildegarde herself, cutting or tending flowers. She
glanced at Bella, and saw in the wide hazel eyes a light
she knew.</p>

<p>On the step came crunching gravel. Bella’s needle
arrested half through a stitch, and all Bella’s face saying,
“John! John Galbraith!”—and only Hildegarde,
through her eyes, hearing. But even Mrs. Mar was under
some spell of silence and strained expectation. Now
the firm tread paused, and there—there, in front of the
low uncurtained window, above the syringas, showed the
head and shoulders of a man. Not Trenn, not Harry.
Who? Hildegarde held her breath.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Was it—<em>could</em> it be?” Bella asked mutely,
with wildly beating heart.</p>

<p>Hildegarde, too, was wide-eyed and pale,
though even in the dusk, plain to see the
vigorous upstanding figure was not a bent
old man’s. Bella felt the happy blood come flooding
back about her heart; only to ebb again with a suddenness
so mighty, that it seemed to withdraw from her, not
gladness only, but volition and all feeling—seemed to
want to carry out life itself upon its backward tide.</p>

<p>For the man had trodden down the flowers in the border,
and pushed his way through the syringa thicket.
He stood at the open window, looking in.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Louis Cheviot,” said Mrs. Mar, with an
affectation of calmness, “where did <em>you</em> drop from?”
And then Hildegarde’s helmeted figure rose up like
some spirit of woman out of another time. But she
stood quite still, and she looked as if she knew she was
dreaming.</p>

<p>Cheviot vaulted over the low sill, and came toward
her with eyes of wonder. “What’s all this for? Why
are you like that?”—but he had grasped her hand.</p>

<p>“That absurd thing on her head? It was to show the
boys,” explained Mrs. Mar. “A ball—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you <em>sure</em> you are you?” Hildegarde found her
voice at last.</p>

<p>“Much surer than I am that you are you. I saw your
light from the street, and I felt I couldn’t possibly wait
to go round and ring the bell. I thought I must come
and look in and see what you were like, though I must
say I didn’t expect—” He was shaking hands with
Mrs. Mar now, but he glanced over his shoulder at the
tall white figure and past it to Bella. “I believe I’ve
succeeded in scaring at least one of the party. How do
you do, Bella? Feel me. I’m not a ghost!”</p>

<p>“My dear boy,” interrupted Mrs. Mar, speaking in
her most matter of fact tone, “sit down and tell us all
about it.” She at all events was not too agitated to put
her marker in the book before she closed it, and she took
up her crochet.</p>

<p>Hildegarde was still standing there, but she had taken
off the helmet and held it in her hand. “Are you—are
you alone?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, alone.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve heard nothing of Mr. Mar?” said
Mrs. Mar, who had never in her life been heard to refer
to that gentleman in any more intimate fashion.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I have.” Cheviot sat down. Hildegarde
still stood there. “I was with him between five and six
months.”</p>

<p>“With father! Has he been to the Klondike, too?”</p>

<p>“No; but I’ve been to Golovin.”</p>

<p>“Your last letter, nine months ago, said you were
coming by the next boat,” Mrs. Mar arraigned him.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I hadn’t heard from Hildegarde when I
wrote that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“What difference did that make?”</p>

<p>“The difference of my following her suggestion to
look out for Mr. Mar. I had to go to Golovin to do it.”</p>

<p>“Is that where he is now?” demanded his wife.
“Why on earth hasn’t he written?”</p>

<p>Cheviot felt in his inner pocket, as he said, “No, Mr.
Mar’s at Nome.”</p>

<p>“At Nome!”</p>

<p>“He—he’s not ill?” faltered Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“No, on the contrary, he’s better than he’s been for
years.”</p>

<p>“Then what on earth’s he doing at Nome?” demanded
Mrs. Mar. “Why didn’t he go to the place
he’s been talking about for all these—”</p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>“Well?” and then, with her peculiar incisiveness,
“What’s he got to show for it all?”</p>

<p>Cheviot did not wonder that Mar would rather not
return to face that particular look in the polished onyx
eyes. “I don’t know,”—he hesitated—“that there’s
very much to show—as yet.”</p>

<p>“It oughtn’t to surprise anybody.” The lady turned
the highly polished stones in her head with an added
glitter.</p>

<p>“When is he coming home?” asked Hildegarde, with
a pitiful lip.</p>

<p>“Perhaps next summer.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps!” echoed the girl.</p>

<p>Even Mrs. Mar stopped crocheting a moment. “Hush,
Hildegarde. Let him tell us.” But she must not be
supposed to be over-anxious. “Have you just come?
Have you had anything to eat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, thank you—in the train. First of all, I must
give you the letters he’s sent.” He handed one to
Mrs. Mar, and one to Hildegarde. Another he laid on
the table under the lamp. It was addressed to Messrs.
Trennor and Harry Mar. Mother and daughter hurriedly
read and exchanged letters.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Bella, how’s the world treating you?”
and Cheviot talked on in his old half-ironic fashion to
the pale girl putting away a heap of tangled silver
thread in a work-box.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar’s eye, grown even harder and brighter in
the last moments, fell upon the envelop under the lamp.
She did not scruple to tear it open. But there was little
enlightenment even in the epistle to “the boys.”</p>

<p>“He says you’ll give us the particulars.” Mrs. Mar
flung the notice at Cheviot as if plainly to advertise her
intention to hold him responsible if those same particulars
were not reassuring.</p>

<p>Cheviot told briefly how he had found Mr. Mar at the
mission, how an eavesdropper had overheard their private
talk, and how Mr. Mar reached his journey’s end
only to find that the thirty-year-old secret had been
filched from him, and other men (who hadn’t known it
but three days), how they had gathered in the harvest.</p>

<p>“Not all—surely father got <em>something</em>?”</p>

<p>“By the time he reached Anvil Creek he found it
staked from end to end.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar was plying the crochet-needle with a rapidity
superhuman. “Of course he’d be too late,” she said,
with a deadly quietness. “Give him thirty years’ start,
and he’ll be too late.”</p>

<p>“It was an outrage that a handful of men should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
have been able to gobble the entire creek,” said Cheviot
hurriedly. “The laws will be changed, beyond a doubt.
They’re monstrous. Every miner has been able to take
out a power of attorney, and he could locate for his entire
family, for all his friends—even for people who
don’t exist.”</p>

<p>“And those missionaries took it all!”</p>

<p>“Not the missionaries. They were chivvied out of the
game by a reindeer herder they’d let into the secret.
It’s too long a story to tell you now, but the herder
gave the missionaries the slip, and got word to some
friends of his. The rascals formed a district and
elected a recorder. By the time we got there, there
wasn’t an inch left for the man who’d discovered the
gold.”</p>

<p>In the pause Hildegarde hunted wildly in her mind
for something to say—something that would prevent her
mother from speaking—but the girl’s tongue could find
no word, her mind refused to act.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the story had reduced even Mrs. Mar to
silence.</p>

<p>“In the end Christianson and Björk didn’t fare
much better than Mr. Mar, though I believe they got
something. But the herder and his friends are millionaires.”</p>

<p>It was more than one of the company could bear. Mrs.
Mar got up and left the room.</p>

<p>Cheviot met Hildegarde’s eyes. There was that in his
face that gave her the sense of leaning on him in spirit—of
being in close alliance with him.</p>

<p>“Poor, poor father!” she said, in a half whisper.
“Does he take it dreadfully to heart?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you can imagine it wasn’t an easy thing to
bear.”</p>

<p>“No, but why isn’t he here—we’ll all help him to
bear it.”</p>

<p>Cheviot looked at the door through which Mrs. Mar
had disappeared. His eyes said plain as print, “Will
she?”</p>

<p>“But father must come home!” Hildegarde broke in
on the eloquent silence, as though upon some speech of
Cheviot’s. “What is he thinking of—he doesn’t
mean—”</p>

<p>Her agitation was so great she hardly noticed that
Bella had finished putting the things away in the work-box,
and was leaving the room. The moment she had
shut the door, “He can’t face it,” said Cheviot.</p>

<p>“Oh, but that’s madness. He must be told that we—that
I—he <em>must</em> come home. Why, it’s the most dreadful
thing I ever heard of in my life, his bearing it all
alone.” Her tears were falling. “Tell me—there’s
nothing in the letters—Louis,”—she leaned forward—“you
and I always tell each other the truth, don’t we?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we do,” he said, with his old look.</p>

<p>“Then tell me <em>what’s in father’s mind</em>. What has he
said to you?”</p>

<p>“That he will stay up there till—somehow—he has
either made his pile, or made his exit.”</p>

<p>The girl laid her head down beside the shining helmet
on the table, and wept convulsively.</p>

<p>“I had to tell you.” Cheviot had come close to her,
and his voice was half indignant, half miserable.</p>

<p>Blindly she put out a hand and grasped his arm.
“Thank you—you—you have been good. His letter to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
me says that you—that you—Louis!” Suddenly she
lifted her wet face, “I <em>am</em> ‘unendingly grateful.’”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you’ll get over it.” He drew his arm
out of her grasp, and walked about the room.</p>

<p>Hildegarde followed him with tear-wet eyes that grew
more and more bewildered. “I can’t understand how
you’re here. I thought navigation wouldn’t be open
for a month.”</p>

<p>“Nearer two.”</p>

<p>“Then, how—how—”</p>

<p>“I came out with dogs over the ice.”</p>

<p>She stared incredulous. “<em>How</em> did you come?”</p>

<p>“Round the coast of Norton Bay, down across the
Yukon, and over to the Kuskoquim, and then by the old
Russian route to Kadiak Island.”</p>

<p>“How in the world did you know the way?”</p>

<p>“Part of the time I had native guides.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it a very terrible journey?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I’d do it again.”</p>

<p>“And when you got down to Kadiak Island?”</p>

<p>“I waited a week for the boat.”</p>

<p>“They run in winter!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Kadiak comes in for a swing eastward of the
warm Japanese current. The boats ply regularly to
Sitka.”</p>

<p>“It must have taken you a long time to do all that
first part on your own two feet.”</p>

<p>He didn’t answer.</p>

<p>“When did you see father last?”</p>

<p>“On the morning of the 8th of December, when I
cracked my whip over my dog-team and turned my back
on Nome.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“Heavens! Why, that’s—”</p>

<p>“Over three months ago.” Most men would have
paused a moment for contemplation of their prowess or
at least of their hardships, but Cheviot was ready to put
his achievement at once and for ever behind him—ready,
not only to imagine the general interest somewhere
else, but to lead the way thither. “To be exact,
it was three months and sixteen days ago; but your
father was all right when I left him, and he had supplies.”</p>

<p>“Has he any friends?”</p>

<p>“He’s got a dog he’s very thick with, and he’s got a
comfortable tent.”</p>

<p>“A tent, in that climate!”</p>

<p>“It’s all anybody has. No lumber for cabins; little
even for sluices, hardly enough for rockers—to rock out
the dust, you know. Wood is dearer than gold.”</p>

<p>“<em>A tent!</em>”</p>

<p>“I assure you there was only one thing he was really
in want of.”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>“Some way to get word to you. He knew you’d be
anxious. He wants you not to take his failure to heart.
He thinks a great deal about that, because he says you
helped—”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p>“He wanted me to make it quite clear to you that in
spite of everything he wasn’t sorry he’d tried it. And
you mustn’t be sorry either. You must write to him,
Hildegarde, and reassure him.”</p>

<p>She nodded and turned away her face, but she put up
her hand like one who cannot bear much more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“He was <em>afraid</em> you were fretting about him. I never
saw him more awfully pleased and glad than when I
made up my mind to come out over the ice.”</p>

<p>“That appalling journey! You did it for him?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t.”</p>

<p>He waited, as if for a sign, and then, speaking almost
surlily, “I did it for myself,” he said. “I’d been away
long enough.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hildegarde, “yes, indeed.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t bear it any longer, sitting there in the
dark and cold, and the”—she raised her eyes—“the—oh,
it’s not such a bad place as people make out; if you
aren’t eating your heart out to know—”</p>

<p>“What’s father doing?” she asked hastily.</p>

<p>“Waiting to hear from you. Waiting, like everybody
else, for the ice to go out.”</p>

<p>“What will he do when the ice goes out?”</p>

<p>“He’s got some claims,” Cheviot lowered his voice
to say. “He doesn’t want anybody but you to know,
for fear there’s nothing in them. But as soon as the
frost is enough out of the ground to yield to pick and
shovel, he means to rock out a few tons of gravel and <em>see</em>.”</p>

<p>“Do it himself!”—then, as Cheviot did not answer at
once, “It’s simply dreadful! It’s—I can’t bear it.”
She hid her face.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Hildegarde. I wish you wouldn’t cry.”</p>

<p>“Are you going back there?”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no; I’m not even going back to the Klondike.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar opened the door behind them. “It must be
hours since you made that miserable meal in the train,”
she said. “Come in here and have some supper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Cheviot would have declined but that he knew he must
some time submit to a tête-à-tête. Best get it over.</p>

<p>After the dining-room door shut behind her mother
and Cheviot, Hildegarde still sat there. The only
movement about the white figure under the lamp was
the salt water that welled up constantly and constantly
overflowed the wide, sad eyes. The handle
of the other door turned softly—a girl’s face looked
in.</p>

<p>“Bella”—the motionless figure rose out of the chair
and the one at the threshold came swiftly in. “Bella”—the
voice was muffled—“my father—my father
doesn’t mean ever to come home.”</p>

<p>The incoming figure stopped. “Do the letters say
that?” Bella asked, awestruck.</p>

<p>“No, Louis says so.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think it was very heartless of him.”</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t. I made him. It would have been
infinitely worse to be always waiting.”</p>

<p>“To be always waiting <em>is</em> perhaps the worst,” said
Bella, with lowered eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, worst of all.”</p>

<p>Bella roused herself and came nearer to her friend.
“But for Mr. Mar—why, it’s impossible—don’t you believe
it, dear. It’s absurd to think—”</p>

<p>“He’ll never come back. You’ll see he’ll never
come back, unless—”</p>

<p>“Unless?”</p>

<p>“Unless”—Hildegarde cleared her tear-veiled voice—“unless
some one goes and brings him home.”</p>

<p>“Louis Cheviot?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see, he’s failed. He’s been enormously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
kind;—he’s been wonderful, but he couldn’t get my
father to come home.”</p>

<p>“Are you thinking one of the boys might?”</p>

<p>Hildegarde shook her head. “They couldn’t make
him.”</p>

<p>“Who could?”</p>

<p>She looked round the room with eyes that again were
filling. But they came back to Bella’s face. “Father
would do it for <em>me</em>,” she said; “don’t you know he
would?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the other, staring, “if not for you, for
no one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, he’d do it for me!” Hildegarde moved
about the room with a restlessness unusual in her. She
went to each window in turn, pulled down the blinds
and drew the curtains; and still she moved about the
room. Excitement had drunk her tears. Her face was
full of light.</p>

<p>Bella did not stir, but no look or move of Hildegarde’s
escaped her. She fixed her eyes on the gleaming dragons
that crawled at the hem of Hildegarde’s skirt. The
voices in the next room were audible, but not the
words.</p>

<p>Across the street the tireless female had again struck
up her favorite march.</p>

<p>“You’d have to go alone,” Bella said presently.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d have to go alone.”</p>

<p>“It’s an awful journey.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the people—the roughest sort of people.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be afraid—at least, not much.”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> shouldn’t dare to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no, you’re younger. And besides, even if I were
the younger, I’m the one who could do it.” Not often
that Hildegarde laid herself open to a charge of arrogance.
“Yes,” she said, with rising excitement, “<em>I</em>
could do it, only”—and the high look fell—“it costs a
great deal.” She stood quite still looking down upon
Brunhild’s shield, that showed on the dark carpet like
a tiny circular pool of gleaming water. Still that maddening
piano over the way! “The boys wouldn’t help
me,” Hildegarde thought out loud, “they’ve already—they’ll
be disgusted enough as it is.” She sat down,
still with her eyes on the shield, as if she didn’t dare
lose sight of it a moment. “Of course mother wouldn’t
dream—” After a little pause, “And Louis would say
I was mad. But I must think—I must think!” She
leaned her tilted chin on her hand, and still like one
hypnotized she stared at the metal disk shining there in
the shadow. “I must find a way. Father shall not be
left up there another winter.”</p>

<p>Nothing more, till Bella brought out quite low the
words, “I could get you the money.”</p>

<p>“<em>Bella!</em>” Hildegarde dropped her hand and sat
back. “Would you?”</p>

<p>Instead of answering, “I wouldn’t dare to go myself,”
Bella said.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>you</em> couldn’t possibly.” (Had Bella really meant
that she might lend—) “Even if there were any need
of it, <em>you</em> couldn’t go.” Hildegarde’s lips only were
saying words, her mind was already faring away on an
immense and wonderful journey, that she—<em>she</em> was competent
to undertake. “You aren’t the kind, anyway,”
she wound up bluntly, coming back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nobody would think you were the kind either—nobody
but me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. You’ve always understood that I wasn’t
a bit like what people thought,” and, indeed, few who
supposed they knew Hildegarde Mar but would have
been surprised at the look in her face to-night, for once
betraying not alone a passionate partizanship with her
father’s stranded and embittered existence, but the glow
that even the thought of “going to the rescue” may
light in a generous heart, and reflect in the quietest face.</p>

<p>“You could do anything you meant to,” said Bella,
marveling a little at the new beauty in her friend, “anything.
But this—you’d have to be very brave to go on
such a—”</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t. I <em>long</em> to go.”</p>

<p>No great surprise to Bella after all, this admission
that Hildegarde, the reticent, the cold, was really burning
with all sorts of eagerness that had never been suffered
expression.</p>

<p>But there was something more here to-night. Like
many another, Hildegarde could have gone through
hardship and suffering for the sake of any one she loved,
but the look on her face as she sat there under the light,
revealed the fact that this journey Bella shrank from
even thinking of, that Hildegarde herself had called
“appalling,” made yet its own strange appeal to the
girl, apart from love of her father, independent of the
joy of service.</p>

<p>“You think if I did it, it would be because I’m brave
and a good daughter, and things like that. No, it’s
none of those things. It’s because, while other people
have been going to New York and to Mexico, to London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and to Paris, and—and—the farthest places, while they
traveled north, south, east, west, I’ve sat here in this
little house in Valdivia, and sewed and planted a garden
and heard everybody else saying good-by, and listened
to that woman over the way playing ‘Partant pour la
Syrie,’ and have still stayed here, and sewed, and gardened,
and only <em>heard</em> about the world. I’ve done it
long enough! I’m going to the North, too!” Hildegarde
stood up with eyes that looked straight forward
into space. A movement from the other seemed to bring
the would-be traveler back. “If anybody will help me,”
she said, turning her eyes on Bella’s face.</p>

<p>The younger girl was on her feet. In the silence the
two moved toward each other. Bella lifted her arms and
threw them about Hildegarde’s neck. “I’ve told you
I’ll help you.”</p>

<p>“I love you very much already, but if you’d do that
for me—” The shining eyes pieced out the broken
phrase.</p>

<p>Bella turned her graceful little head toward the dining-room
door. Cheviot had raised his voice. But they
couldn’t hear the words.</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing”—Bella spoke in a whisper—“just
think a moment; all those hundreds of miles
with a dog team over the ice, in an arctic winter. If
anybody else had done such a thing we should never
have heard the last of it. The world wouldn’t be long
in having another book on heroism in high latitudes.
But we all know <em>that</em> man”—she moved her head in the
direction of the voice—“we’ll never hear of it again.
He’s done that gigantic journey just for you,”—Hildegarde
disengaged herself—“and to be with you again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
And here you are planning to go away. It isn’t my
business, but I think you’ll be making a terrible mistake,
Hildegarde, if you—”</p>

<p>Her friend turned from her with unusual abruptness.</p>

<p>“He’s nicer than ever,” Bella persisted. “He’s
charming. I always said so.”</p>

<p>“And I always said”—Hildegarde stopped and looked
at Bella with an odd intentness. “You’re a nicer girl
than you used to be.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the other, smiling faintly, but she
saw that she had failed.</p>

<p>“And I don’t mean because you’re willing to help
me in this.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“There’d be only one thing that could prevent my
letting you lend me the money.”</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly needn’t worry about paying it
back.”</p>

<p>“It would take two or three years, but that could be
managed now that Trenn and Harry want to give me an
allowance. It isn’t that.”</p>

<p>Bella waited wondering.</p>

<p>“It is that I couldn’t take a great, great help from
you, and go so far away, carrying anything in my heart
that—that I’d kept hid—anything that concerned you.”</p>

<p>A quick fear leapt into Bella’s face.</p>

<p>“For one mightn’t come back, you know,” the other
added.</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing we’ve never straightened
out,” said Bella, “and that’s <em>my</em> tangle.”</p>

<p>“I have my share in the thing, I mean. But as I said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
you couldn’t do now—what you did—when you were
little.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Bella drew a sharp breath of relief. “When
I was little I know I was a beast.”</p>

<p>“You told Louis Cheviot about the altar, and the
patron saint; about—”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bella hastily. “It was pretty mean of
me, but I was only twelve.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t only when you were twelve.” Gratitude,
common prudence, should have bridled Hildegarde’s
tongue, but there was something of the judgment day
about this hour. Hearts must needs be opened and secrets
known. “It was after,” she went on, driven by
this new necessity to leave nothing hidden if she was to
take Bella’s help, “it was six years after—when you
were eighteen. You had gone away knowing quite well
how—how I was feeling about—You knew how I was
feeling. Yet you could write pretty heartlessly, considering
all things. That gay letter about your engagement.
You could write with that insincere air of expecting
me to be as happy as you were.”</p>

<p>“You surely see it would have been unpardonable of
me to have sympathized with you. I <em>had</em> to assume you
didn’t care. You would have done the same.”</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>Bella looked at her. “That’s true,” she said, quite
low. “You would have shown that you were sorry for
me, even in the middle of being happy yourself. You
could have done it and not hurt. But I couldn’t. I
didn’t know how. The nearest I could come to it was
just to pretend I thought you’d got over it—that you
didn’t care any longer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>They looked at each other a moment without speaking.
Bella with quivering face glided forward.</p>

<p>“Dearest, dearest”—she took Hildegarde’s hand, she
caught it to her breast. “You aren’t going to let him—the
Other—spoil <em>two</em> lives!”</p>

<p>“At least I’m ready to risk what’s sure to happen.”</p>

<p>“What’s sure to happen?”</p>

<p>“His coming while I’m away.” Hildegarde flung
out the words with a passion Bella had never seen in her
before. “Yes, that’s what will happen. I shall have
waited for him at home here all my life <em>till</em> this summer.
And this summer, while I’m gone, he’ll come to
Valdivia. You’ll see! He’ll come.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-n.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">No prevision of Hildegarde’s as to Cheviot’s
disapproval of her plan approached the degree
to which he fought against her going
to the North.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar, secretly dismayed at her husband’s
willingness to stay away indefinitely, was not ill-content
for once to see the “stolid Hildegarde” stirred
to action. It satisfied a need in the mother, that the
daughter had never ministered to before. Hildegarde
was the sort of girl who could take excellent care of
herself, and her health was superb. She had no important
concerns such as the boys had to chain them at home.
She was not the mother of a family, nor even president
of the Shakspere Society. The welfare of the Hindus
would be wholly unaffected by her departure. The journey
was quite unlike that terrible one involved in going
to the Klondike. It could be made in a comfortable
ship; the whole of it by sea. Her mother would go with
her to the steamer, and Hildegarde would stay on board
till her father met her at the Alaskan port.</p>

<p>But they had all reckoned without Cheviot.</p>

<p>He refused to take the idea seriously at first, and when
he did—oh, he was serious enough then!</p>

<p>“The maddest scheme that ever entered a sane head!”
Hildegarde had no conception of what such a journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
was like. The ships were the most uncomfortable in the
world. Freight boats, with no accommodation for
women. The food appalling. The company—oh, it
didn’t even bear talking about!</p>

<p>But Cheviot did talk of it, to Bella, when he discovered
her complicity, and so effectually he talked that she
withdrew her support.</p>

<p>Hildegarde was speechless with indignation. What
spell had he cast that Bella could “go back” on her
word. Truly a thing to depend upon—Bella’s friendship.</p>

<p>“Oh, please try to understand. I was always frightened
at the idea, even before Louis told me—”</p>

<p>“Why should you be frightened,” said Hildegarde
sternly. “It isn’t as if I were a rescue party and my
little journey were to the other side of the world. I
shouldn’t sail from Norway, and I shouldn’t catch up
with anybody in Franz Josef Land.”</p>

<p>“Hildegarde! You’ve never spoken to me like that
before in your life.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve never admitted before that you’d failed
me.”</p>

<p>Bella, with flushed face, got up to leave the room.
“You think I’m backing out only because of what Louis
says. But I meant to tell you it would have been terrible
to me to be responsible for your going, after what you
said that night Louis came home.”</p>

<p>“What did I say?”</p>

<p>“That this summer, while you’re gone—”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“There will be news.”</p>

<p>“You mean from—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” Bella steeled herself. “As soon as I’d got
you out of the way—”</p>

<p>Hildegarde winced; rather dreadful that she should
have said that to Bella—too like what the average male
critic would expect. “Did I say <em>you</em>, Bella? I only
meant fate.”</p>

<p>“You were sure he would come this summer. Stay
and see.”</p>

<p>“It’s only if I’m not here that John Galbraith will
come.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde had a final interview with the arch culprit,
Cheviot.</p>

<p>“I had no idea you could be like this,” she said, toward
the close.</p>

<p>“Then it’s as well you should know.”</p>

<p>It ended in a breach. He came no more to the
house. Hildegarde passed him in the street with lowered
eyes.</p>

<p>And Bella had gone home.</p>

<p class="tb">The spring went creeping by.</p>

<p>Now June was gone. Even July. Still no news.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Hildegarde dully, “father isn’t coming
back.”</p>

<p>August was waning—not even a letter. And from
that other more terrible North, no syllable of the tidings,
that to reach those two waiting in California, must
come round by the old world, and all across the new.</p>

<p>“He is dead,” Hildegarde said to herself, and it was
not of Nathaniel Mar that she was thinking.</p>

<p>The boys had generously sent their father both money
and advice. He was recommended to use the sight draft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
on the Alaska Commercial Company, for the purpose of
buying his home passage by the very next ship.</p>

<p>At last, when the season was drawing to a close—news!</p>

<p>Not that expected—but something no man had looked
for.</p>

<p>Gold had been discovered in the sands of the Nome
beach.</p>

<p>Men who had been stranded there—arriving too late
for a claim on the creeks—a broken and ragged horde,
were now persons of substance and of cheerful occupation,
that of “rocking out” fifty to a hundred dollars a
day upon the beach at Nome. The gold was not here
alone, but under the moss and the coarse grass of the
tundra. It clung to the roots when you pulled up the
sedgy growths. It was everywhere. What was the contracted
little valley of the Klondike compared to this!</p>

<p>“The greatest of all the new world gold-fields has been
found. A region, vaster than half a dozen Eastern
States, sown broadcast with gold-dust and nuggets.
Easy to reach and easy to work.”</p>

<p>Here was the poor man’s country. If you didn’t
want to rock out a fortune for yourself, you could earn
fifteen dollars a day working for others.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The beach for miles is lined with miners’ tents. Anvil
City (hereafter to be called Nome) is booming.</p>

<p>“Building lots that six months ago were worth nothing,
to-day bring thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>“Where a year ago was only a bare, wind-swept beach
on Bering Sea—one of the most desolate places to be
found on earth and beside which the Yukon country has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
a fine climate—there is to-day a city of several thousand
people, surrounded by the richest placer-diggings the
world has seen.”</p>

</div>

<p>The gold-laden miners returning to Seattle by the last
boats of the autumn, told the reporters with a single
voice, “The world has known nothing like Cape Nome.”</p>

<p>Tongues went trumpeting the mighty news, pens flew
to set it down, and telegraph operators flicked the tidings
from one end of the earth to the other.</p>

<p>The word “Nome,” that had meant nothing for so
long to any man but Mar—it became a syllable of strangest
portent; stirring imaginations that had slept before,
heralding hope to despairing thousands, setting in motion
a vast machinery of ships and of strange devices,
and of complicated human lives.</p>

<p>New lines of steamships bought up every craft that
could keep afloat; companies were formed to exploit the
last new gold-saving device; men who had fallen out of
the ranks, returned to the struggle saying, “After all,
there’s Nome!”</p>

<p>“And this is the moment Mr. Mar will naturally
choose for turning his back on the North.” It was so
that his wife successfully masked her secret anxiety for
his return. It was as if she resented so sorely her growing
uneasiness about him—fought so valiantly against
the slow-dawning consciousness of the share she had in
his exile, that she must more than ever veil secret self-criticism
by openly berating him. Above all she must
disguise the impatience with which she awaited his return
“this autumn, at the latest.” “Now,” she would
say, “now that even he couldn’t fail to make a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
thing by staying, he—oh, yes, to be sure, <em>he’ll</em> come
hustling home!” If only she had been the man!</p>

<p>One of the last boats brought a letter. There <em>was</em> gold
in the beach sand, Mar wrote, but every inch was being
worked over and over, and its richness had been exaggerated.
The place was overrun with the penniless and
the desperate. The United States military post established
there was powerless to maintain law and order.
Drunkenness, violence, crime, were the order of the day.
The beach was a strange and moving spectacle.</p>

<p>“Spectacle! He goes and looks on!” was Mrs. Mar’s
way of disguising her dismay. He returned the boys’
money, “since it was sent for a purpose so explicit.” He
was “staying in.”</p>

<p>Other letters, brought by the same steamer, told what
Mr. Mar had omitted to mention: that typhoid fever was
at work as well as those gold-diggers on the famous
beach.</p>

<p>Men were dying like flies.</p>

<p class="tb">The third winter came down, and the impregnable ice
walls closed round “the greatest gold-camp on the
globe.”</p>

<p>“Typhoid! Even if he escapes the fever, he will stay
up there till he dies, unless—” Hildegarde was glad
she had not yet bought anything for the coming season.
In spite of her brothers’ allowance she would become a
miser—hoarding every coin that came her way. She
would make her old gowns do, even without Bella’s
transforming fingers. She thought twice even about
spending car fare. To eke out her resources she would
sell Bella’s beautiful presents, and the first boat that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
went north in the spring should carry Hildegarde to
her father—or to his grave.</p>

<p>It was gray business waiting for this first summer of
the century. What news might one expect from a man
lost four years ago between Norway and Franz Josef
Land? What from that other in the nearer-by North,
where men dug gold and fought typhoid? What fatality
was it that made of all hope and all desire a magnetic
needle? Hildegarde remembered how Bella, to the question,
“Why do you suppose there’s this mania among
us for the North?” had answered, “I don’t know, unless
it is that we have the South at home. Perhaps Hudson
Bay people and Finlanders dream of the tropics. I
don’t know. But I’ve heard nothing so afflicts a
Canadian as hearing his country called ‘Our Lady of
the Snows.’ I think there never was such a beautiful
name. But it may be because I live with orange blossoms
all about me.”</p>

<p>Certainly it was harder waiting without Bella. Together
each year they had hoped for news. Now apart,
they feared it.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, what helped Hildegarde through the
heavy time was the establishment of an understanding,
half incredulous, wholly unavowed, between her and
her mother. It appeared she had Mrs. Mar on her side—else
why did that lady save up every newspaper reference
to the new gold-camp to read aloud as Hildegarde
sat at her sewing. The most transcendent classic ever
penned would be put aside for—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘Extracts from the note-book of Mr. McPherson, the
third man to strike pay on the beach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>‘(They are absolutely correct, as I saw his diary and
the mint returns for the gold, which were at the rate
$19 an ounce, yielding him nearly $10,000.)</p>

<p>‘Aug. 11th.—Macomber and Levy: about a mile and a
half from Anvil City. Here I got a nugget weighing
$4. The nugget was found in the sand, about 250 feet
from low tide. Jim Dunsmuir and William Bates told
me that they had averaged $40 per day rocking. They
were about eleven miles south of Anvil. Price, on No. 8
Anvil, Sunday, 20th of August, sluiced out $6,400 in
seven hours, with six men. Lindblom took out $18,000
in eighteen hours, with six men, August 14th.</p>

<p>‘Aug. 29th.—Leidley made a wooden caisson and sunk
it about 250 ft. beyond low tide, and got from fifteen to
fifty cents per shovel. I did not see this experiment, but
I believe firmly that the richest part of the beach is
beyond low tide.</p>

<p>‘There will be more money come out from Nome than
came from the Klondike.’”</p>

</div>

<p>“Here’s a column headed—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“‘A REGION RICHER THAN PIPE-DREAMS</p>

<p>“‘Nome defies all theories and every precedent. Its
greatest mines have been found, and its greatest fortunes
have been made by men who knew nothing of mining.
Gold has been discovered by lawyers and doctors, dry-goods’
clerks, plow-boys, barbers, fiddlers and politicians,
in a thousand places where old miners would
have sworn, and did swear, it was impossible. Millions
of dollars in glittering dust and nuggets have been
thawed out of frozen rubble and moss, and washed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
ocean beaches and other unheard-of depositories by
young divinity students, country printers, piano professors
and didapper dandies, whom nobody ever suspected
of knowing grindstones from thousand-dollar quartz, or
iron pyrites from free gold.’”</p>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Mar read on, intoxicating herself. “Here’s a
woman who was up there in the summer when the beach
gold was found. She’s brought home $15,000, and a
claim she refused to take $38,000 for.”</p>

<p>But if there was anything about typhoid in the paper
Hildegarde had to find it out for herself. Little by little
she knew that however deterred her mother had been by
Cheviot’s onslaught the spring before, she was either
consciously or unconsciously coming to look favorably
on Hildegarde’s old plan.</p>

<p>What the inexperience of the girl could not guess was
that Mr. Mar’s absence had taught his wife several
things. And that lady had no inclination to gather another
year’s harvest of the bitter fruit. If Hildegarde
could get him to come home, Hildegarde ought to be supported
in spite of Cheviot and the boys. But real confidence
between them was so little easy, that the girl said
nothing to her mother of her plan to raise money by selling
the beautiful necklace and the other things that Bella
had from time to time brought home to her from abroad.
Hildegarde would go to a man she could trust—“the
family jeweler,” as they called the individual whose
high office had been to restore the pins to brooches that
Mrs. Mar’s energetic fingers had wrenched off, and to
mend Mr. Mar’s grandfather’s watch-chain when it
broke, as it used, two or three times every year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>To the family jeweler, then, Hildegarde took her box
of treasures. “What are they worth?”</p>

<p>The little man screwed a glass in his eye, and examined
rare stones and renaissance enamel with an
omniscient air.</p>

<p>“I know you’ll do your best for me,” Hildegarde said
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Of course—certainly, Miss Mar. Not very new, are
they?”</p>

<p>“New! Oh, no—they’re so old they’re very valuable.”</p>

<p>“Yes. H’m. Yes.”</p>

<p>“I need all you can possibly get me for them, Mr.
Simonson.”</p>

<p>“I’ll examine them thoroughly, Miss Mar, and let
you know.”</p>

<p>As she went out, there was Bella coming down the
street. Acting on an impulse, Hildegarde turned off the
main thoroughfare, pretending not to see. But it made
her heart sore to think, “Bella in Valdivia, and not with
us! I not even to know!”</p>

<p>Miss Wayne went into the familiar Simonson’s.
“Was that Miss Mar who was here a moment ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is it broken? That’s the necklace I got for her
in Rome.”</p>

<p>“No, not broken. I suppose you don’t remember what
you gave for it?”</p>

<p>Miss Bella put on her most beguiling air, and took the
old man into her confidence. She would buy the things
herself and pay him a commission, and he was not to say
but what a San Francisco dealer had made the two-hundred-dollar
offer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;" id="illus6">
<img src="images/illus6.jpg" width="450" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“‘I know you’ll do your best for me,’ Hildegarde said, anxiously”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>When she got back to her hotel she telephoned to
Cheviot.</p>

<p>The next day that young gentleman had an interview
with Hildegarde’s brothers down at the ranch. They
were even boisterously of Cheviot’s opinion. They
would simply refuse their consent to their sister’s undertaking
such a journey. But to Cheviot’s anxious sense
they spoke too airily. Too certain they could prevent
the abomination.</p>

<p>“Don’t antagonize her, you know,” warned Cheviot.
“Make her see the reasonableness of our—of your objection.”
And the boys agreed.</p>

<p>Even before Cheviot had made money in the Klondike,
and come home to be made a partner in the bank; the
Mar boys had looked upon him, not only as a probable,
but as a highly desirable brother-in-law.</p>

<p>They soothed his natural indignation at Hildegarde’s
foolishness, and they told him they’d meet him at the
bank after giving her a talking to.</p>

<p>They were late for the appointment, and the moment
they appeared in the room behind the public offices,
Cheviot saw they had not prospered.</p>

<p>“Hildegarde’s the most pig-headed creature in the
universe!”—and a few more illuminating details.</p>

<p>“But why didn’t you tell her—”</p>

<p>“Told her everything. Water on a duck’s back.”</p>

<p>“But what did she say?”</p>

<p>“‘Women have done it before.’”</p>

<p>“It’s not true!” cried Cheviot, jumping up. “The
world has never seen anything comparable to what this
year’s rush to Nome will be. The mob that will be
going—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“She quotes the Klondike, ‘That was worse,’ she says,
‘yet there were women among the men who got there, lived
there, and came home.’ Damn it! it’s true, you know!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t true. The Klondike was a totally different
proposition. The people who got to the Klondike the
year of the rush were all picked men—a few women, yes,
I admit, a few women—God help them. But the mob—a
rascally crew enough, lots of them—but they were
men of some means, men of brawn and muscle and
mighty purpose or, simply, they didn’t survive. If they
weren’t like that, they turned back as thousands did,
from Juneau, from Skagway, from Dyea—or they fell
out a little further on. Didn’t I see them on the Dalton
trail and the Chilcoot Pass, glad to lie down and die?
I tell you, only the hardiest attempted it, and only the
toughest survived. <em>That’s</em> the sort of pioneer that
peopled the Klondike. Nome’s another story. Nome’s
accessible by sea. Any wastrel who can raise the paltry
price of his passage can reach the American gold-fields.
Any family disgrace can be got rid of cheap by shipping
him to Nome. Any creature who’s failed at everything
else under the sun has this last chance left. Be sure
he’ll go to Nome—<em>with Hildegarde</em>! Good God!
Drunkards, sharpers, men—and women, too (oh, yes,
that sort!), and people hovering on the border line of
crime or well beyond it—<em>they’ll</em> fill the north-bound
ships. Hildegarde alone with such a crew!” Cheviot
jumped to his feet. “I’d infinitely rather a sister of
mine were struggling with a pack on her back over the
Chilcoot Pass along with the Klondike men of ’97, than
see her shut up on board a ship with the horde that will
go to Nome.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>He walked up and down the little inner office, his eyes
bright with anger and with fear. And he added terrors
not to be put before the girl herself, but for the mother,
if Hildegarde should be obdurate. “Make her understand
that Nome this summer will be the dump-heap of
the world.”</p>

<p>“I did,” said Trenn, distractedly. “I gave her my
opinion of what they were like—those other women she
quoted who had gone. It wasn’t even news to her!”</p>

<p>“What! She accepted that?”</p>

<p>Trenn looked profoundly humiliated. Any nice girl
would have pretended she couldn’t credit such a state
of things, even if she’d heard them hinted. But Hildegarde
had said gravely, “Yes, I know what you mean,
miserable women have done it for horrible ends. It’s
that that makes me ashamed to hesitate. Can’t a girl
venture as much for a good end as those others for—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hildegarde’s mad!” said Trenn, with a flush
on his handsome face.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, she’ll go,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“But Mrs. Mar! What’s she about?”</p>

<p>Cheviot went to see.</p>

<p class="tb">“You surely don’t mean to let her go?”</p>

<p>“My good man, I’d like nothing better than to go
myself.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you?” demanded Cheviot rudely.</p>

<p>Another woman might have pointed out that she was
in her sixty-second year. No one would have expected
such an excuse from Mrs. Mar. There was something in
her face Cheviot had never seen there before, as with
obvious unwillingness she brought out the answer, “Hildegarde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
can do this errand best. At least, as far as concerns
her father. Of course”—she recovered some of
her native elasticity—“if <em>I</em> went I’d get a claim, too.
You’d see! I’d come home with a fortune. I doubt if
Hildegarde does, though she has more in her than I’ve
sometimes thought. Hildegarde won’t come to any
harm.”</p>

<p>Cheviot, too outraged for the moment to speak, got up
and looked blindly for his hat. When he found that, he
had also found his tongue. “The only comfort I can
see in the miserable affair is that she’ll find two hundred
dollars isn’t nearly enough. There isn’t a place
on the globe where living costs as much as it does at
Nome.”</p>

<p>“She’s been saving up her allowance for a year.”</p>

<p>Cheviot threw down his hat. “I tell you it would be
mad for an able-bodied man to go with less than a thousand
dollars margin.”</p>

<p>“Hildegarde can’t raise anything like that. But
she’ll have enough to get her there, and something
over.”</p>

<p>Cheviot looked at her. “You mean she’s ready to go
without even enough for her return expenses?”</p>

<p>“She says she can leave the question of returning.”</p>

<p>“She knows we—her brothers will send out funds to
get her back!” groaned Cheviot, beginning to walk up
and down. “And she, <em>Hildegarde</em>, is willing to embarrass
her father by being a charge on him?”</p>

<p>“She won’t stay long. And Nome lots are selling for
thousands. Her father has at least the land his tent
stands on.”</p>

<p>Cheviot struck his hands together in that startling if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
infrequent way of his. It made even Mrs. Mar rather
nervous. “Go and argue with her yourself,” said the
lady, with raised voice and a red spot glowing on either
cheek. “I shouldn’t be able to move her. I never have
been able to move Hildegarde. That’s the worst of
these quiet people.”</p>

<p>“You say that, and yet you aren’t really opposing
her.”</p>

<p>“Me? No,” said Mrs. Mar, fixing him with unflinching
eyes. “I’m making up the deficit.”</p>

<p>Cheviot had never before longed to murder a fellow
creature. “You realize, of course,” he said quietly,
“she isn’t even sure of finding her father alive.” Angry
as he was, when he saw the look that thrust brought
to Mrs. Mar’s face, he was sorry he had presented it so
mercilessly. “What she’ll probably find,” he hurried
on to say, “is that Mr. Mar has gone to the Casa da
Paga. That was his plan. Or the Fox River—or God
knows where.”</p>

<p>“If she goes as far as Nome, she’ll be able to go still
further,” said Hildegarde’s mother, though her voice
wasn’t as steady as her words implied.</p>

<p>“I understand you, then, at last!” Cheviot stopped
before her with anger-lit eyes. “You are ready to see a
young girl—”</p>

<p>“Not every girl.”</p>

<p>“A girl like Hildegarde.”</p>

<p>“Precisely, one like Hildegarde. She can do it.”</p>

<p>“Poor Hildegarde!” burst from his lips, and the implication,
“to have a mother like you,” would have
pierced many a maternal breast. But it glanced off Mrs.
Mar’s armor and fell pointless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hildegarde Mar”—with an air of defending her
daughter from Cheviot’s low opinion of her—“is a person
of considerable dignity of character.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it necessary to tell me that?”</p>

<p>“Singularly enough, yes. And to add that I who
know her best, have never yet seen her show any sign of
not being able to take proper care of herself.”</p>

<p>“Under ordinary conditions. But, as I told the
boys—”</p>

<p>“A woman who can’t take care of herself under conditions
out of the ordinary, can’t take care of herself at
all.”</p>

<p>Again Cheviot opened his lips, but Mrs. Mar, grasping
the arms of her rocking-chair, indoctrinated the purblind
man. “The truth is, that a girl in good health,
who hasn’t been kept in cotton, and who hasn’t been
seared by men’s going on as you’re doing, is far abler
to cope with life than—than—” She pulled herself up
an instant, seeming to feel that after all man is hardly
worthy to know the whole truth upon these high themes.
But she thought extremely well of Cheviot, or she would
never have permitted him to speak to her as he had
done. And he loved Hildegarde. “The truth is,” she
went on, “Hildegarde is quite right about this. There’s
no reason why she <em>shouldn’t</em> go half as strong as the
reason why she should.”</p>

<p>“The reason! You think it’s on account of Mr. Mar.
It isn’t. Bella will tell you Hildegarde <em>wants</em> to go on
this degrading journey. She said everybody had traveled
about and seen the world but her. She had never
been farther than Seattle to see Madeleine Somebody.”</p>

<p>“That’s true.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“You see! Hildegarde is full of curiosity about—things.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, why indeed! But the fact opened my eyes to
how much—how little Mr. Mar’s welfare has to do with
her crazy scheme.”</p>

<p>“It hasn’t opened your eyes very wide, Louis.” Mrs.
Mar shook her head with the air of one looking back over
a long road painfully traversed. “Nobody shrinks more
from a fuss and a falling-out than Hildegarde. This
winter, without Bella, and without you, and without—It
hasn’t been easy for Hildegarde. She would have
given in about Nome long ago, but for—” Mrs. Mar
suddenly leaned forward again, and speaking hurriedly,
“Somehow or other Hildegarde <em>knows</em>. I believe she’s
known all along.”</p>

<p>“Knows what?”</p>

<p>“What her father meant to do.”</p>

<p>“About not coming home?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“She knows that because I told her.”</p>

<p>“You knew it!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And yet”—she gripped the arms of the rocking-chair,
and her eyes shone—“you come here to get me to
prevent the only step being taken—”</p>

<p>“No! Only to protest against Hildegarde’s taking it.
Good heavens!”—he was losing his self-control—“Hildegarde
is—”</p>

<p>“Well and strong, and no such fool as you seem to
think.”</p>

<p>He set his square jaw. “A little young for such a—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“Twenty-six.”</p>

<p>“You forget or don’t know she’s also—attractive.”</p>

<p>“Attractive!” Mrs. Mar repeated with a weight of
contemptuous meaning. “Since what you imply is so
little a credit to your sex, I may be allowed to say she
has shot at a mark with her brothers, and if it’s necessary,
she can carry a revolver.”</p>

<p>“Good God! And you’re her mother!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar sprang to her feet. “Yes, I’m her mother,
and that I didn’t myself suggest her going to get her
father to come home, is only that I’m under the spell of
the old foolishness about women. The fact is, that
we’re much better able to look out for ourselves than
men are—yes, stare as much as you like! It’s so.
You’re all <em>babies</em>, I tell you, and if the women didn’t
look after you, you’d be <em>dead</em> babies!”</p>

<p>Cheviot snatched up his hat a second time and walked
to the door. Mrs. Mar, seeing him going off like that
with never another word, and with that fixed wretchedness
on his face, quickly crossed the room and took hold
of his arm, as his hand was on the door knob. “Hildegarde
is only going to do in a more open way what
women are always doing,” she said.</p>

<p>Cheviot turned angrily, but so astonished was he to
see tears on her face that he stood speechless.</p>

<p>“Some woman said it in a magazine the other day,”
she went on, “but every woman who’s good for anything
is doing it.”</p>

<p>“Going to Nome!”</p>

<p>“Going out to the battlefield in the evening to look
after the wounded.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-h.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Hildegarde wrote to Madeleine Smulsky,
now Mrs. Jacob L. Dorn. Madeleine’s husband,
being a Pacific Coast importer in a
large way, might be able to advise in which
of the fleet of steamers advertised to sail
from San Francisco, and certain to be the first boat of
the year to reach Nome—in which should a traveler put
trust.</p>

<p>The answer brought Mr. Dorn’s somewhat scornful
profession that he knew nothing whatever about the
hastily formed San Francisco lines, and little good
about the mushroom companies of his own city, but if
Hildegarde thought of sailing from Seattle he would
look into the matter for her. Seattle was the better port,
being the natural gateway to the North (Hildegarde
could hear Mr. Dorn saying that), in witness whereof
the bustling, booming city swarmed already with more
prospective passengers than there were ships to float
them—all wisely laying in their provisions, buying machinery
and outfit in that best of all places—San Francisco?
oh, dear, no! in Seattle, the City of the Future!
Hildegarde must at all events come and visit the Dorns.
Under the guidance of Madeleine’s husband, she would
probably find out that, at best, the journey to Nome was
impracticable for a lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>The middle of April found Miss Mar a guest of the
Dorns. Jacob L. seemed presently to abandon all idea of
dissuading his wife’s friend from carrying her wild
scheme into execution, but he pointed out the little need
there was to rush blindly into avoidable difficulties.
Better ships were in process of being chartered for the
northern service, in view of the undreamed-of demand.
The season, moreover, was late this year. Those earlier,
inferior vessels (schooners and what not) that were to
get off before the middle of May would only spend the
time “knocking about the North Pacific, among the icebergs.”</p>

<p>So Hildegarde waited while Mr. Dorn looked thoroughly
into the question. Even looking into it seemed
perilous. It told on the gentleman’s health, as one might
suppose. When Hildegarde had been only a few days
under his roof, her host took to his bed with congestion
of the lungs.</p>

<p>Madeleine absorbed in nursing the husband had little
time for the friend. Hildegarde was suddenly thrown
on her own resources. But she felt it would be impolitic
to write that fact to Valdivia. From one shipping office
to another, from Southwick’s Great Outfitting Emporium
to the Baumgarten Brothers’ Wholesale Provision
House, she went in quest of information; threading
her way through the bustling streets, where among
the featureless thousands, day by day she often saw the
figure of the frontiersman in broad-brimmed hat and
brown boots, laced to the knee; or the weather-beaten
miner, in “waders” and brown duck or mackinaw.
“<em>They’re</em> coming to Nome!” she would say to herself,
looking on them already as fellow-travelers. One feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
much with her is perhaps really rather new in
woman’s experience, among the many things called
“new” that are yet so old. It seems as if never before
her generation could it have been a matter of course to a
girl like Hildegarde Mar, that she should feel instinctively
it would be as absurd to treat these bearded frontiersmen
with condescension, as to be terrified of them.
Not that she analyzed the situation. It was too simple
for that. Her feeling was merely that these uncouth
fellow-creatures were possible friends of hers. As she
met and passed them, or in imagination “placed” them
in her coming experience, her mental attitude was singularly
untarnished by the age-old anxiety of the unprotected
female casting about for a champion. Something
less self-centered than that, something kindlier, less the
child of fear. Cheviot might have qualms, but man was
not for Hildegarde her natural enemy. A woman alone
was not obliged to peep furtively about for shelter, or
for some coign of vantage, like one pursued in a hostile
land. Not his immemorial prey, she; but like him the
possible prey of circumstance, with ignorance for her
arch-enemy as well as his. Those booted and sombreroed
men—some of them at least—had already met and overcome
the common enemy. They would be masters of the
situation up there. Herself the mere ignorant human
being, eager to learn, innocent of class-illusion, intensely
alive to “differences,” yet knowing which of them were
only skin-deep, or rather education-deep; young, yes;
attractive, too; a girl going into a strange new world
who yet goes fearlessly, hopefully, carrying faith in
human nature along for her shield and her buckler. If
this is an apparition new upon the earth, then perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the modern world has something to be proud of beyond
the things it has celebrated more.</p>

<p>Not that she encountered no difficult moments. She
was stared at, and she could see that she was speculated
about. Well, that was no killing matter. Perhaps it
was because she was so tall. When in the thronged and
noisy offices she was crowded and pushed by an excited
horde—though shown no special disrespect as a woman—she
was certainly not comfortable, and was even a
little forlorn. When a brow-beating passenger-agent
vented his ill-temper upon her refusal to buy a ticket
forthwith without waiting “to inquire further,” she felt
the man’s rudeness keenly, absurdly. But it was not
till some “masher” of a clerk spoke to her with a vulgar
familiarity that discomfort went down before humiliation
in the thought, “What would Louis say if he
knew?” However, the clerk soon saw his error, and the
tall, quiet girl was taken at a different valuation. Men,
even the most ignorant men, learn these lessons more
quickly than is supposed. But, oh, it wasn’t easy to do
the work of preparation alone! comparing, eliminating,
deciding all by oneself. For at every step, upon every
question, one encountered conflicting testimony. Every
store-window that one passed displayed things “Indispensable
for Nome.” Every ship that sailed was the
best, and bound to be first at the goal. Now and then to
some one of the besieging hundreds at the offices, Hildegarde
would put a question. The women looked askance.
The men answered civilly enough. But if they
knew little more than Hildegarde, they entertained
darker fears. And still, and always, testimony was in
conflict. The firm that impressed her most favorably,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
whose office she had just left “to think it over”—why
they, it seemed, were a set of thieves. Passage on one of
their ships meant ten to twenty days’ starvation on short
rations of sour bread and salt horse. Heavens, what an
escape! But that other firm she was on her way to interrogate—they
were traffickers in human life! Didn’t
she know they had been buying disabled craft of every
description, even hauling up abandoned wrecks out of
the sea, sweeping the entire Pacific for derelict and
rotten craft that they might paint and rename, and make
a fortune out of crowding such crazy vessels full of
ignorant human cattle for Cape Nome?</p>

<p>But these people, proprietors of the New Line, in
whose offices they stood—their ships if starting later
were at least seaworthy. Seaworthy? ’Sh! Their ships
didn’t so much as exist. These men only waited, postponing
sailing dates on one pretext or another, till they
had got your money and filled, and over-filled, the lists
of their phantom ships. When they’d done that, you’d
see! They’d pocket their thousands and abscond into
Canada.</p>

<p>While Hildegarde waited hesitating, even on the
smallest and least faith-inspiring boats the passenger
lists rapidly filled. And still every train that thundered
into the Seattle station disgorged its hundreds clamoring
to be taken to Nome. Already, since Hildegarde’s arrival,
a number of schooners and several steamers, with
flags flying and bands playing, had gone forth to meet
the early ice floes. Would these daring ones get any
further, after all, than the Aleutian Islands before June?
“You’ll see they’ll have to put in at Dutch Harbor
for a month!” Hildegarde saw men; standing in dense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
crowds on the wharves, shake their heads, as they
watched each ship go forth on the great adventure.</p>

<p>“All my life,” thought the girl, “I shall remember
the port of Seattle, when the first boats went to Nome.”</p>

<p>There were those who might seem to have more cause
than Hildegarde Mar to remember that unprecedented
spectacle. For to the wonderful “Water Front” sooner
or later every creature in Seattle found his way—commonly
to suffer there some strange, malignant change.
Even the quiet ones began to emit strange sounds, and to
tear about as if afflicted with rabies; the most self-controlled
went mad among the rest. They fought their way
through the barriers, men and women alike; they
screamed about their freight upon the docks; hurrahing
and gesticulating, they saw maniac friends off, on ships
whose decks were black with people, whose rigging, even,
swarmed with clotted humanity, like bees clinging in
bunches to the boughs of a tree.</p>

<p>In the “orderly” streets of a great city, a girl like
Hildegarde would have been remarked, followed, probably
accosted. She had had experience of that even in
Valdivia, where nearly every creature knew who she
was. In the vast and eager crowd on the Seattle water
front she passed with little notice and wholly unmolested.
Every one had business of his own. If the man
who pushed against you till he nearly knocked you down
was not an excited passenger rushing for the next ship,
he was a company agent seeing off a hundred thousand
dollars’ worth of machinery; or he was the gentleman in
a smaller way of business, who was beating up trade in
the neighborhood of the Last Chance Bazaar. Here and
there on a tiny temporary platform, nearly swamped by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the crowd, or standing insecurely on a jostled barrow,
merchants whose ages ranged from eight to eighty, offered
you something you’d bless them for every hour of
your life at Nome. Here an improved sort of prospecting
pan—you had only to carry it up to lat. 62° to fill it
full of gold all day long. There was a Nome mosquito-mask,
fastened like a gallows’-cap on the face of a stiff,
pale figure of wax, lifted high in air, rigid, travestying
death—horribly arresting. There was every kind of
waterproof—hat, coat and boot; for, that summer at
Nome meant nothing but rain, was the one point upon
which every one agreed. By way of object lesson,
“rockers” for separating Nome gold from Nome sand
are being jogged to and fro upon the wharves; vendors
of patent medicine are crying one another down; a different
concentrated food is proclaimed at every corner,
a new gold “process” every ten feet and bedlam all
around you. Copper plates; pickaxes; shovels; and—“Here
y’are! The last thing out! Compound-corkscrew-screw-driver-monkey-wrench,
’n’ can-opener. All
y’ grub goes to Nome in cans. Y’ll starve to death
right plumb in the middle o’ plenty, ’nless y’ get this
yer noo compound-corkscrew-screw-driver-monkey—”
The rest is drowned by the <i lang="fr">dernier cri</i> in “Nome
sto-o-o-ves! Burn-oil-burn-wood-burn-coke-burn-anything-in-hell-and-never-burn-the-dinner!
Nome
sto-o-o-ves!” Other hawkers so hoarse you heard nothing
but “Nome! Nome!” as if they had it there—a
nostrum you might buy at home.</p>

<p>Hildegarde’s mind went back to the old reconnaissance
map in the dining-room. She so little she must climb
upon a chair to read in her father’s fine, clear writing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the name opposite a tiny projection in the coast line. It
had been a place only he seemed to know about. Now
on every sign, on every lip, Nome! Nome! Nome!</p>

<p>Overheard fragments among new-comers at the shipping
offices, no more “Which boat?” but “Can you, even
by paying some feller a bonus, get anything in the shape
of a ticket before June?”</p>

<p>The element of chance was not to be eliminated. It
must be faced. On her way to the office of the Line she
had first affected, she saw swinging on in front of her,
hands in overcoat pockets, shouldering his way through
the throng, one of those same high-booted, wide-hatted
men of whom she had said at first, “He’s going, too!”
But this man had been marked out by his air of enjoying
the enterprise. Most people, even away from the
maddening water front, bore about with them a harassed,
or at best, preoccupied countenance, the majority sallow
and seamed and weary. This wide-mouthed young
giant with the fresh complexion—he was one of whom
you felt not only “he knows,” but “he knows it’s all
right.” Now, if he should be on his way to secure a
passage at this same office, Hildegarde would take it as
a lucky omen. But he carried his tall figure swinging
by. His back seemed to say, “No, thank you. I know
too much to be taken in by the <em>Golden Sands Company</em>.”
Hildegarde went past the Golden Sands Company herself,
without quite intending to. The ruddy-complexioned
one was stopped by a fussy little, middle-aged
man, who said, “Wonder if you can tell me where the
Centrifugal Pump Company’s offices are?”</p>

<p>“What?” says the red-cheeked giant as Hildegarde
went by. “You mean Mitchell, Lewis and Starver?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Y-yes,” said the fussy man. “Are they all right,
do you think?” and the rest was lost. What a pity she
couldn’t go up as simply as that, and ask his Giantship
about the boats. But no. He was a rather young giant,
and a little too enterprising-looking. No, better not. He
stared at people. That wasn’t the sort of man she’d
ever spoken to.</p>

<p>She hadn’t analyzed it, but with all her simplicity
and all her sense of freedom, she was acutely sensitive
about making any avoidable move that might be misconstrued.
The unfortunate women of the world had
spoiled things. Not only for themselves—for others, too.
She crossed the street and went back toward the “Golden
Sands.” Glancing over her shoulder, she saw the giant
part from his interlocutor and disappear in the office of
Hankin &amp; Company. So that was the best line!
Slowly she retraced her steps, turning over in her mind
all she’d heard about Hankin &amp; Company. Perhaps
even without this last indication the evidence did point
Hankinward. She went in. Craning over heads, and
peering across shoulders she saw the huge young man
talking to the agent. She edged her way nearer.</p>

<p>“You’ll have plenty o’ time to load your stuff. The
<i>Congress</i>’ll be at the docks Toosday.”</p>

<p>“Sure?”</p>

<p>“Dead certain.”</p>

<p>The giant nodded and strode out on seven-league
boots. A moment later Hildegarde had laid $125 down
before the alcohol-reeking, red-eyed, nervous agent, who
seemed to feel called on to explain that he’d been up all
night “on the water front, seeing off the <i>Huron</i>.”
While he made out the voucher, huskily he congratulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the young lady that an intending passenger by this best
of all ships had had a fit on the water front the night
before, and was probably dying now “over at the Rainier
Grand.” His wife had been in half an hour ago about
reselling the ticket. And that was it. Number twenty-one.
He handed Hildegarde the slip of gray-blue paper
which transferred to her the dying man’s right to a first-class
berth on Hankin &amp; Company’s Steamer <i>Congress</i>,
sailing from Seattle to Cape Nome on the 19th of May.</p>

<p>Now for a decision amongst the contending outfitters
and provision dealers.</p>

<p>She had studied well the prospectuses, the “folders”
and the hand-books. She had made notes and lists. She
knew she must provide herself with:</p>

<p>“<i>A tent and two pair dark blue Hudson Bay blankets.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Water boots.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Several yards stout netting.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Leather gaiters.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Cowboy’s hat.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Canvas bag, with shoulder strap.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Oil stove, and oil.</i>”</p>

<p>To this, upon her mother’s initiative, she proposed to
add a pistol; on her own, four pounds of chocolate and a
handsome supply of peppermints.</p>

<p>She had culled from newspapers, books, and advertisements
at least six different lists of the kind and quantity
of food one would need. Already she had ordered several
cases of mineral water, but she was still pondering
“evaporated eggs,” “desiccated potatoes,” “malted
milk tablets,” and “bouillon capsules,” as she stood in
one of the great provision houses that very day she had
got her ticket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The place was crowded. Here, as elsewhere, a few
women among the many men; both sexes equally bent on
business. While she waited in the throng, a clerk who,
with difficulty, had been making his way to her, interrupted
a query modestly preferred by a little weather-beaten
woman in black. As if he had not heard the one
who spoke, of the one who had said nothing he asked,
“Is anybody looking after you?”</p>

<p>“As soon as the lady has finished—” began Hildegarde.
The rusty one glanced at her fellow-woman in
some surprise, and said again to the clerk, “I just
stepped in to ask you to be sure to have a keg of witch-hazel
ready to go out with our stuff. You ran out of it
last year.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you Mrs. Blumpitty?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Have you given your order?” The clerk’s manner
had changed, he had plenty of time now.</p>

<p>“Mr. Blumpitty will step in to-morrow about it. He
is quite a little rushed to-day, hunting around for a place
to sleep in.”</p>

<p>“There’s a good many doing that,” said the clerk.
“There hasn’t been a room vacant at a hotel for a
week.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right. And we got a party of twenty-eight
this time. I only wanted to jog you about that
witch-hazel.” She was moving off.</p>

<p>Hildegarde stood in the way. “Are you going to
Nome?” asked the girl.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind telling me what you are going to do
with witch-hazel, up there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>“A person wants witch-hazel everywhere.”</p>

<p>“Why do they?”</p>

<p>“Best doctor in the world.”</p>

<p>“What’s it good for?” Typhoid was in the ignorant
mind.</p>

<p>“Good for anything. Burns, cuts, bruises, anything.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Down at the foot of the list, after peppermints,
went witch-hazel. Again the little woman showed
signs of moving on. But she looked back at Hildegarde
over her shoulder and, as if to imply: this much I leave
you, even if you <em>are</em> too good-looking to inspire confidence.
“Witch-hazel ain’t like those noo things they
advertise. It’s been tested.”</p>

<p>“Oh, has it?”</p>

<p>She didn’t know much, this young lady. “Guess it
<em>has</em>,” said the little woman. “In every country store
in my part of the world, you’ll find a keg of witch-hazel!”
and with that she would have been gone but that
the crowd pressed her back.</p>

<p>“What is your part?” asked Hildegarde.</p>

<p>The woman looked round at her suspiciously.
“Maine.”</p>

<p>“You come all the way from Maine to go to Nome?”</p>

<p>She nodded. “Guess everybody here but you is goin’
straight to Nome.” Her eye fell on Hildegarde’s pencil,
suspended above the list held too high for the little
woman to know its exact nature. “Noospaper woman?”
she said, putting the most charitable construction on the
presence here among the hard-featured horde of a person
like this.</p>

<p>Hildegarde had been asked that question before.
“No,” she said, and saw her credit fall in the rusty one’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
eyes. “But I’m going to Nome, too,” the girl hastened
to add, wishing to recover ground. But it was plain she
had only further damaged herself.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the witch-hazel advocate, moving off with
some precipitation through a momentary opening.</p>

<p>Hildegarde found the clerk who had seemed to know
Mrs. Blumpitty. “Have you heard what boat she’s
going by?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the clerk, “but she’ll go by the best, I bet.”</p>

<p>“Why do you say that?”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s one o’ the few that knows the ropes.
She was there last year.” And he was called away.</p>

<p>She might know Hildegarde’s father!</p>

<p>Early the next day the girl reappeared at Baumgarten’s.
No, she wasn’t going to give her order just yet.
She was waiting to see Mrs. Blumpitty. So the Baumgarten
Brother turned from her to advise a customer
against taking saccharine instead of sugar. “You’ll
come to hate the taste even in tea and coffee, and, as for
eating it sprinkled on anything, you’ll find you simply
can’t.” A group of people were hotly discussing vegetables,
and whether to take them desiccated or “jest as
they are.” The new ones “not in yet,” the Baumgarten
Brother admitted; “and the old ones sure to sprout,”
said some one else. A Klondiker gave his views: “Take
’em dried. Lot less freight on the boat. Lot easier
packed about afterwards.” A babel of voices rose:
“Tasteless,” “No good left in ’em,” “No feeding
power.” Another voice: “Who cares about how easy it
is to take somethin’ that’s no good?” “People go on
about evaporated food jest as if it was the Klondike and
the Chilcoot Pass all over ag’in. ’Tain’t. Nome’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
different proposition.” The Baumgarten Brother was
instructed to put down half the order in dried and half
in fresh. Then a detachment went away to see opened
and to taste a new brand of canned cooked sausages.
People stood about with pickles and shavings of
“chipped beef” and cheese samples in their hands, nibbling
and looking thoughtful. Others ate butter off the
end of a penknife, and said, “It ain’t no better ’n margarine,
an’ costs more.” When for two hours and ten
minutes Hildegarde had stood there against the low
columnar wall of piled tomato cans (a kind of basaltic
formation, showing singularly regular “fracture” and
wide range of color-stain), the clerk of yesterday gave
her a stool to perch on in the corner. Many of the
crowding faces were grown already familiar. There was
the fresh-complexioned giant. He came in with a pleasant
towering briskness, and stood talking to one of the
Baumgartens. As Hildegarde watched him, she told
herself she was glad that man was going on “her” ship.
Then reflecting, “Why, I’m staring at <em>him</em> now!” she
turned away her eyes, and there suddenly was Mrs.
Blumpitty, with a thick-set, dun-colored husband—his
face a grayish-yellow, his hair a yellow-gray, his eyes
yellow, with pale gray irises.</p>

<p>Hildegarde descended from the high stool and made
her way to the couple. “Is it true you were at Nome
last summer?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Mrs. Blumpitty drew closer to the dun-colored
husband, as if more than ever mistrustful of the tall
young lady.</p>

<p>But Hildegarde took no notice of that. “I wonder,”
she said, “if you met a Mr. Mar up there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman looked at her husband, and he looked
straight along his nose. It was a long nose, and it
seemed to take him a great while to get to the end of it.</p>

<p>Hildegarde couldn’t wait. “Yes, Mr. Mar,” she said
eagerly, “Mr. Nathaniel Mar.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think—” began the woman.</p>

<p>“Oh, please try to remember. He is very thin and
tall, with bushy hair. I feel sure you’d remember him
if you thought a moment. He is the kind people remember.”</p>

<p>Something in the trembling earnestness of a person
who looked as self-possessed as Hildegarde had its effect.</p>

<p>“You can know people up there pretty well and never
hear their names. Nome is like that. I may have seen
him.”</p>

<p>Oh, how close it brought him to hear the dun-colored
husband saying, “I may have seen him!”</p>

<p>“A young man?” asked the wife.</p>

<p>“No,” said Hildegarde, and she was shaking with excitement.
“He is gray, and he—he is very lame.” This
bald picture of her own drawing suddenly overcame her.
“Try,”—she found herself catching at the rusty arm—“try
to remember. He is my father.”</p>

<p>“Oh, your father,” said the woman in a different
tone, and the vague man turned his pale eyes on Hildegarde
as though only now fully aware of her.</p>

<p>“Lame! There was a lame man. No, I never spoke
to him.”</p>

<p>“We weren’t much in Nome,” the woman explained.
“Our claims are out on Glaysher River, and we were at
our camp there most of the time.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde leaned against the brilliant dado of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Delicious Tomato Soup, and she looked so disheartened
the man said, “Was you thinkin’ o’ goin’ out?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m going to him.”</p>

<p>“Big party?”</p>

<p>“No, no party at all.”</p>

<p>“You’re not goin’ alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m the only one of my family who has time.”</p>

<p>The pale eye fell on Hildegarde’s list, which she still
had in her hand. “If your father’s there you won’t
have to take supplies.”</p>

<p>“I must go prepared for—anything.” And she
turned her face away.</p>

<p>After a pause, “You got anybody to advise you?”
said the man.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The rusty woman looked at the vague man, and the
vague man looked at Van Camp’s Soup.</p>

<p>“Where are you at?” he said presently.</p>

<p>Hildegarde stared.</p>

<p>He pushed back his black slouch hat and sadly mopped
his yellow-gray brow. It was warm to-day. The crowd
at Baumgarten’s made it seem warmer still. “Which
hotel?” asked Mr. Blumpitty.</p>

<p>“I’m not at any hotel. I am at Mr. Jacob Dorn’s.”</p>

<p>“Jacob L. Dorn’s?”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you know him?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know him, but I know his firm.” It was
plain the name had impressed both Blumpittys.</p>

<p>“What boat you goin’ in?” asked the yellow-gray
man.</p>

<p>“The <i>Congress</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the <i>Congress</i>?”</p>

<p>Blumpitty shook his head, murmured, “—pretty hot,”
and slowly divested himself of his overcoat. That done
he stood revealed in black from head to heel. Something
inexpressibly funereal about him now, that the dun-colored
coat had masked. “Pity you didn’t know about the
<i>Los Angeles</i>,” he said dolefully.</p>

<p>“What is there to know about her?”</p>

<p>“She’s goin’ to be fitted up in style.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shan’t mind style.”</p>

<p>“We’re goin’ on the <i>Los Angeles</i>,” said the little
wife.</p>

<p>“I do mind that—not going with you.” Hildegarde
looked into the woman’s weather-beaten face, and
felt regret deepen.</p>

<p>From columns of Van Camp Mr. Blumpitty raised
his weary eyes and they fell on an acquaintance in the
crowd. You saw that even the teeth of the dun-colored
husband were yellow-gray. But the effect of his watery
smile was altogether gray, and without suspicion of any
hue less somber. It made you think of a dripping day
in November, with winter all before you. But lo! it was
the cheerful giant Blumpitty had recognized. How long
had he been there at Hildegarde’s elbow.</p>

<p>“What’s that I heard you sayin’ against the <i>Congress</i>?”
he demanded of Blumpitty. “<i>Congress</i> is the
best boat goin’.”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t get passage for all of us on the <i>Congress</i>,”
said Blumpitty meekly.</p>

<p>“And we didn’t want to be divided,” contributed
Mrs. Blumpitty.</p>

<p>“We’re sure the <i>Los Angeles</i> is all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“What makes you sure?”</p>

<p>“Becuz she’s just fresh from the Gover’mint service.”</p>

<p>The giant laughed, and took out a big silver watch.
Hildegarde saw with a start of surprise that it was past
luncheon time.</p>

<p>“They <em>do</em> keep you hangin’ around here.” Blumpitty
looked wearily at the crowd. “Guess I’ll go and
make an appointment with Baumgarten for right away
after breakfast to-morrer.” He moved off with the
giant at his side and the small wife at his heels.</p>

<p>Hildegarde hurried back to Madeleine’s, where behold
Mrs. Mar and Harry!</p>

<p>“The boys began to fuss when they read in the papers
about Mr. Dorn being ill.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right—about me, I mean,” said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“I told you it would be,” Mrs. Mar said to Harry.
“Now, here we are in a town where every hotel is full to
overflowing, and Jacob Dorn dying—to judge by the way
Madeleine behaves. But she always was a little theatrical—that
girl.”</p>

<p>“No, her husband is very ill. I feel I oughtn’t to be
here myself, really.” Obvious enough Hildegarde’s dismay
at the apparition of her family. Ignorant as she
was, already she had learned how little help the average
person could be about this undertaking. The Blumpittys
were different. She told about them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar no sooner heard of their existence than she
said: “Now, if you could travel with a respectable
couple—” In vain Hildegarde pointed out she was
going on another ship. Anyhow, those people could tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Hildegarde things—they could advise. Anybody but
Hildegarde would have had them here and pumped them
well. The girl, in a subdued voice, reminded her mother
that it was a house whose owner lay dangerously ill.</p>

<p>“The very reason! Mr. Dorn isn’t advising you, as he
promised. You must find some one who will. Oh, you
<em>are</em> slow-witted! Where are those people staying with
their foolish name? You don’t even know their address?
Well, upon my soul, it’s a good thing we did
come, after all! How you’ll ever be able to get on by
yourself, <em>I</em> don’t know.” In a trice Mrs. Mar had
despatched Harry to scour Seattle, to ransack every hotel
register in the place, “And don’t come back here without
those Blumpittys.”</p>

<p>When, at four o’clock, there was no news either of
Harry or them, Hildegarde and her mother set out together—having
told the Japanese servant to keep anybody
who called, as they’d be gone only half an hour.
If the Blumpittys, Mrs. Mar said, were not among the
crowds in the principal street, they’d very probably be
on that water front Hildegarde had written about.</p>

<p>But no, not a Blumpitty to be seen. On their way
home—the giant. “He might know—he’s a friend of
theirs,” Hildegarde said.</p>

<p>Without an instant’s hesitation Mrs. Mar accosted
him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-m.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“My daughter thinks you know a man and his
wife of the name of Blumpitty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” said the giant, pulling off
his broad hat.</p>

<p>“Do you know where they are to be
found?”</p>

<p>“I just now left Blumpitty up in the Stevens House
bar.”</p>

<p>“In the bar! The man drinks?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, not to say <em>drinks</em>,” said the cheerful one,
smiling broadly.</p>

<p>“What’s he doing in the bar then?”</p>

<p>“Just talkin’ to the boys.”</p>

<p>“Then will you go right away and ask him—”</p>

<p>“There’s Harry!” Hildegarde was making signals.</p>

<p>“Well, <em>you’re</em> not much good at finding people,” his
mother greeted him. “But we’ve got Blumpitty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how d’you do,” said Harry, prepared to accept
the giant in this rôle. Hildegarde explained, and
the final move in the mission was committed to her
brother. The ladies were to go home and trust Harry to
“bring Blumpitty along.” They were reassured when
they saw the giant disposed to accompany the expedition.</p>

<p>Within an hour, there was Blumpitty haled before
Mrs. Mar, like a criminal before his judge.</p>

<p>“Well!” Mrs. Mar glanced from her son to the clock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
“And you wouldn’t have found him even at this hour
but for Hildegarde and me.” Harry’s answer to this
(and to Hildegarde’s, “Remember, we must speak low,
Mr. Dorn’s room is just above”) was to whisper, as if
divulging some tremendous secret, “Mr. Blumpitty.”
Then, still more significantly, “<em>My mother.</em>” My
mother fastened her bright eyes upon the stranger who
had obliged her by responding to her call. Plainly she
was not prepossessed. The giant had either been wrong,
and Blumpitty <em>did</em> drink (in which case Mrs. Mar was
wasting her time), or else the man naturally looked
“logy”—a fatal way of looking.</p>

<p>“Please sit down, Mr. Blumpitty,” said Hildegarde,
speaking very low. Mr. Blumpitty, more than ever with
the air of a mute at a funeral, deposited himself on the
extreme edge of a chair.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Harry, by way of breaking the chill of
his mother’s reception, “you see, Mr. Blumpitty wasn’t
on any hotel register.”</p>

<p>“Why weren’t you?” demanded Mrs. Mar, as though
this were a damning charge.</p>

<p>“No room anywhere,” said Blumpitty sadly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope you found a place to sleep in—” began
Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“Wa-al, yes, after huntin’ around two whole days.”</p>

<p>“Two days!” says Mrs. Mar, ready to nail him for a
liar at the start, and so save time. “There’s a night in
the middle of two days.”</p>

<p>“Ya-as. We wished they wusn’t.”</p>

<p>“Where did you sleep?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t sleep much.”</p>

<p>“Where did you stay?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the station.”</p>

<p>“Station!” Visions of his being “run in” assailed
Mrs. Mar. “What station?”</p>

<p>“The G. N. W.,” he said indistinctly.</p>

<p>“The Great North Western Railroad Station,” Harry
translated, with a reassuring look at the man.</p>

<p>“You slept in the waiting-room?”</p>

<p>“Some of us slept.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, I hope you’ve got nice quarters at last?”
said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“Wa-al, we got three rooms. But,” gloomier than
ever, “we got to pay for ’em.”</p>

<p>“What do you want of three?” demanded Mrs. Mar.</p>

<p>“Three ain’t too many fur twenty-eight people.”</p>

<p>“Twenty-eight! What are you doing with so many?”</p>

<p>“Takin’ ’em to Nome.” Had the destination been the
nether regions, he couldn’t have said it more as one who
had left hope behind.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul!” said Mrs. Mar, with a vision of the
crowded train she’d come by, and the yet more crowded
streets she’d hunted through for this same Blumpitty.
“What are they all going to do there?”</p>

<p>Blumpitty smiled a faint world-weary smile. “They
kind o’ think they’d jest natchrully like to get a share
o’ this gold that’s layin’ around up there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re a prospecting party.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll do some lookin’ around.”</p>

<p>“Twenty-eight of you!” exclaimed Hildegarde under
her breath. “In three rooms!”</p>

<p>The man nodded slowly, and his yellow-gray eyes
seemed to have a vision of them. “Layin’ in rows,” he
said sadly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“How dreadful!” breathed Hildegarde. In truth it
had a morgue-like sound.</p>

<p>“No—o,” he drawled. “No—o. Me and Mrs. Blumpitty,
we do kind o’ miss it, not havin’ any winder. It’s
only a closet though,” he said, as if not wishing to hurt
the feelings of anything so small and unpretentious.
“And the rest of our people are all right. Some parties
have had to mix up, but I been able to get a room for
the men, <em>and</em>”—he spoke with a weary pride—“<em>and</em>
one for the ladies.”</p>

<p>“Ladies in your party!” exclaimed Harry.</p>

<p>“Ya-as. Five, not countin’ Mrs. Blumpitty.”</p>

<p>“What kind?” demanded Mrs. Mar, at the same moment
as Harry asked, “What are <em>they</em> going to do up
there?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re all right,” said Blumpitty, thinking he
answered both. “Miss Leroy Schermerhorn’s goin’ to
keep the books, and be secretary and business woman to
the Company.”</p>

<p>“What company?” says Mrs. Mar.</p>

<p>“Blumpitty &amp; Co.,” says Mr. Blumpitty.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul!” says Mrs. Mar.</p>

<p>“Remember Mr. Dorn,” whispered Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“Do I understand your wife is going along—” Mrs.
Mar began on a lower note.</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes. I couldn’t do it without Mrs. Blumpitty.”</p>

<p>“Where does she come in?”</p>

<p>“Everywhere. Little bit o’ woman, so high. You’ve
seen her.” He turned to Hildegarde. She nodded,
smiling. “Don’t weigh more’n ninety-six pounds.
Worth twenty or’nary size people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“What does <em>she</em> do up there?”</p>

<p>“Everything. Keeps it all together.” He looked
round with a melancholy wistfulness, as if he felt keenly
the need of Mrs. Blumpitty to keep the present situation
together.</p>

<p>“And the other women?” said Mrs. Mar.</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Tillinghast is the wife of the baker.”</p>

<p>“What baker?”</p>

<p>“The Company’s.”</p>

<p>“Blumpitty &amp; Co.’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am. Then there’s Miss Cremer. She’s a
tailor—goes along to keep us mended up till our clo’es
get wore out. Then she’ll make us noo things. Mrs.
Blumpitty had to do it all last year. Pretty heavy fur
a little woman no bigger’n—”</p>

<p>“The baker’s wife and the tailoress, that makes two
besides Mrs. Blumpitty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am. An’ there’s Miss Estelle Maris. Very
nice young lady. She <em>says</em> she can cook.” He sighed,
and then recovered himself. “Even if she can’t, Mrs.
Blumpitty can. Yes”—he allowed a pale eye to wander
toward Miss Mar—“we got very nice ladies along, and
I mean ’em all to have claims.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar glinted at him, as much as to say, “Oh,
that’s the bait—poor wretches!”</p>

<p>“It’ll be very nice for them,” said Hildegarde a little
hurriedly.</p>

<p>“How do you expect them to get claims?” asked Mrs.
Mar with severity.</p>

<p>“The Company’s got some valyerble property up on
Glaysher Crick.”</p>

<p>“What company has?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“Blumpitty &amp; Co.”</p>

<p>“And are they giving claims away?”</p>

<p>He looked at Mrs. Mar, quite unruffled by her tone.
“The Company’s got more’n it can work. And the
Company knows where there’s good property nobody’s
taken up yet.”</p>

<p>“Who’s in the Company?”</p>

<p>“Me and Mrs. Blumpitty, and her folks, and my folks,
and most of our party.”</p>

<p>“Oh, just a family affair,” said Mrs. Mar, with a
slighting intonation.</p>

<p>“Very few besides jest ourselves. We didn’t want a
lot of outsiders.”</p>

<p>From Harry’s covert smile you gathered this was a
new view of the way to float a mining company. “Why
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“We seen what happens too often,” said Blumpitty
warily.</p>

<p>“What does happen?” asked Mrs. Mar.</p>

<p>“The people that’s the first to locate ain’t often the
ones that gets the benefit.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t they?”</p>

<p>“They get froze out. I mean to hold on to the bulk
o’ the stock myself jest as long’s ever I can. Keep
things in my own hands.” He looked anxious.</p>

<p>“Not let other people take up the stock, you mean?”
inquired Harry, smiling openly now.</p>

<p>“It’s the only way,” said Mr. Blumpitty, and then,
as though to change a dangerous topic, “We got a nice
party.” He looked toward Hildegarde. “Pretty near
all the perfessions. We got a smart young lawyer and
two practical miners. We got a nengineer an’ a noospaper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
man. An’ we got a nex-motor man—used to drive
a ’Frisco street car, and a very bright feller. Ya-as, we
got a carpenter, too, an’ three doctors an’ a boat-builder
an’ a dentist. We got pretty near everything.”</p>

<p>“How long were you up there before?” asked Mrs.
Mar, still feeling her way with this queer character, who,
with his wife, might after all be decent fellow-passengers
for Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“We was in two summers an’ one winter.”</p>

<p>“Your wife, too?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, she kep’ us alive. If y’ wus to see her y’
wouldn’t think she looked like she—”</p>

<p>The discreet Jap servant opened the door, and seemed
to whisper, “Mis’ Bumble Bee.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how do you do?” Hildegarde went quickly forward
and shook hands with a tiny, weather-beaten
woman.</p>

<p>“I heard on the water front you wus askin’ for me,”
said the new-comer, looking very shy and embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Mrs. Mar was on her feet. “Is this Mrs.
Blumpitty?” Before that little person knew what had
happened, she was on the other side of the room, shrinking
into the extreme corner of a big, red satin sofa—not
unlike some sort of insect hiding in the heart of a poppy.
But it was idle trying to escape from Mrs. Mar. She
prodded her prisoner with pointed questions, and there
was no manner of doubt but “Mis’ Bumble Bee” was
intensely frightened. But she must have come out of
the ordeal uncommon well, for the catechist rose at the
end of a quarter of an hour (breaking in upon Harry’s
glib exposition of the huge difficulty in these days of
floating a gold mining scheme). “Your wife and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
been arranging things,” said Mrs. Mar, with a suddenness
that made Blumpitty blink. “My daughter must
go on your ship.”</p>

<p>“But, mama—”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Blumpitty says she will look after you on
board.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the rusty wife, a little breathless.
“And if she doesn’t find her father just at first she can
stay with us, can’t she?”</p>

<p>Blumpitty, thus appealed to, said, “Ya-as,” so entirely
without enthusiasm, that his wife added, “He said
to me after we’d talked with your daughter, ‘It’s a pity
she ain’t goin’ on the <i>Los Angeles</i>. We could ’a’ helped
her.’”</p>

<p>“Well, she is going on the <i>Los Angeles</i>.”</p>

<p>“No, mama, the <i>Congress</i>.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be pig-headed, Hildegarde. Why should you
insist on the <i>Congress</i> when here are Mr. and Mrs. Blumpitty
ready to look after you on the <i>Los Angeles</i>?”</p>

<p>“I don’t exactly insist, but I’ve paid $125—”</p>

<p>“You can change your ticket, if that’s all, can’t she?”
Mrs. Blumpitty appealed to the repository of wisdom on
the edge of the chair.</p>

<p>“Oh, ya-as,” said Mr. Blumpitty.</p>

<p>“Why are you so sure?” said Hildegarde. “Is it because
the <i>Congress</i> is so much the better boat, as your
big, tall friend said?”</p>

<p>“He ain’t right about that, though he’s a mighty
smart feller. Been to Harvard College,” he said, for
Mrs. Mar’s benefit. Then, as one adducing a destiny
higher still, “The <i>Los Angeles</i> has been a Manila transport.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“But why does everybody seem to want to go in the
<i>Congress</i>?”</p>

<p>“Sails four days earlier,” said Blumpitty unmoved.
“But”—he glanced, or no, Blumpitty never glanced;
with apparent difficulty he rolled his pale eye heavily
over to Mrs. Mar—“settin’ out’s one thing, gettin’ in’s
another. ’Tain’t likely the <i>Congress</i>’ll see Nome ’fore
we do.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, what are four days compared to—?” Mrs.
Mar turned briskly upon her daughter. “Mrs. Blumpitty
is going to see that you have all the necessary
things, and if you’re sick she’s going to look after
you.”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Blumpitty did not instantly corroborate this
result of the fifteen minutes in the red satin corner,
“You promised me that,” said Mrs. Mar, with a suddenness
that sounded less like maternal solicitude than
truculence, “and <em>I</em> promised you shouldn’t be a loser
by it.”</p>

<p>“Yes—oh, yes, ma’am, I’ll do all I said.” Merely
looking at Mrs. Mar seemed to galvanize Mrs. Blumpitty
into heroic mastery of her shyness. She clasped her thin
hands in their gray cotton gloves tightly together, and
felt herself called upon instantly to prove her present
knowledge and prospective usefulness.</p>

<p>“H-have y’ got a boy’s rubber coat, comin’ to the
knees?” she inquired of the younger lady.</p>

<p>“No,” said Hildegarde. “Ought I—?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you must have that, mustn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Ya-as.”</p>

<p>“And waterproof boots?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“With asbestos soles?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“They’re the best.”</p>

<p>“Get them,” commanded Mrs. Mar.</p>

<p>“And one thing you can’t do without is a blue denim
prospecting dress.”</p>

<p>“I think I have something that would do, though I
don’t expect to go—”</p>

<p>“Has your dress got knickerbockers and skirt to the
knee?” She saw Miss Mar and her mother exchange
glances, but she felt instinctively the elder lady would
see the reasonableness of the provision.</p>

<p>“No,” said the young lady, “my skirts are ankle-length.”</p>

<p>“Oughtn’t to be a hairbreadth below the knee,” said
Mrs. Blumpitty, with more firmness than she had yet
shown.</p>

<p>“No skirt at all is best,” observed Mr. Blumpitty
dryly.</p>

<p>“What!” said Harry Mar, whom every one had forgotten.</p>

<p>“Jest full knickerbockers,” said Blumpitty, without
so much as looking at the objector.</p>

<p>“Oh, that won’t be necessary for me,” said Miss Mar.</p>

<p>“’Twill, if you want to go prospectin’.” Valiantly
Blumpitty supported his wife’s view. “You can’t wear
a skirt on the trail.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I shall go on the trail,” said the pusillanimous
Hildegarde, “unless my father—”</p>

<p>“Better be ready,” said Blumpitty.</p>

<p>“What else do you advise?” said Mrs. Mar, glancing
at the clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“She ought to have a sou’wester, don’t you think?”
says Mrs. Blumpitty to Mr. Blumpitty.</p>

<p>“Ya—as, and a tarpaulin to lie on in the swamp.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Mar, “nobody can accuse you two
of over-coloring the delights of life up there.”</p>

<p>“It’s a splendid place, Alaska is, if you go with the
right things,” said Mrs. Blumpitty.</p>

<p>“And if you come away with the right things,” supplemented
Mrs. Mar.</p>

<p>“Oh, she must bring back a claim, mustn’t she?”
Mrs. Blumpitty appealed to her husband.</p>

<p>Harry and his mother exchanged looks.</p>

<p>“Well, never mind about that,” said Mrs. Mar. “But
if you see after my daughter and do what you said, you
won’t be losers by it.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Harry, with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Blumpitty,” quoted Mrs. Mar, “Mrs. Blumpitty
says she’ll see that Hildegarde is properly cooked
for up there, and she’ll even get her washing done.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I can do that myself. I’m used to it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look very strong,” said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t before I went to Alaska,” she answered
proudly.</p>

<p>“Ya—as,” agreed her husband. “Always terrible
sickly till she went up there. Ruth’s jest the same.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Ruth?” demanded Mrs. Mar.</p>

<p>“That’s my niece,” said Mrs. Blumpitty.</p>

<p>“You had her along last year?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and she’s comin’ again. She wouldn’t miss
comin’ fur anything. Ruth’s twenty-five,” Mrs. Blumpitty
explained to Miss Mar. “Reel nice girl. Been a
nurse. You’ll like Ruth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>It was as if the “reel nice” Ruth finally settled things.</p>

<p>“Give Harry your <i>Congress</i> ticket, Hildegarde, and
he’ll see about changing it. Even if he can’t, I’ve made
up my mind you must go on Mrs. Blumpitty’s ship.
Don’t let the grass grow, Harry, we must catch the night
train home.”</p>

<p>When Harry had ceased to cultivate grass in Jacob
Dorn’s parlor, the Blumpittys seemed to think their
audience, too, was at an end. They stood close together
and muttered embarrassed leave-taking.</p>

<p>“Wait till my son gets back,” interrupted Mrs. Mar.
“He oughtn’t to be more than twenty minutes. There
are one or two things I’d like to know.” The fact did
not elude Mrs. Mar that when she had headed off their
escape, Mrs. Blumpitty had taken refuge in the chair
nearest her husband, and was edging it as close to him as
she could conveniently get—for protection, it would
appear. And Blumpitty himself, as feebly he resumed
his perch, looked more than ever depressed and vague.
Mrs. Mar needed no reminder that few husbands and
wives are as communicative together as either may be
apart. “Hildegarde,” she said, “take Mrs. Blumpitty
up to your room and see how much of your outfit’s
right. Show her your list and take notes of what she
tells you.”</p>

<p>Having cleared the deck, Mrs. Mar by a cross fire of
questions drew forth a story, no—queer fragments,
rather, of the history of the Blumpittys’ fight for existence
during sixteen months spent in a tent upon the icy
tundra, with a few Esquimau neighbors and no white
soul for many a mile. Mrs. Mar forgot to look at the
clock, even grew strangely friendly with Blumpitty, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
her absorption in so congenial an occupation as drawing
out and clarifying an inarticulate, rather muddled male.
Finally, “The papers,” quoted Mrs. Mar, “the papers
say that all the claims are staked.”</p>

<p>Without the smallest emphasis, “I know that ain’t
so,” said the man dully.</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“I been there.” Mrs. Mar digested this. “I know,”
Blumpitty went on, “a place where no white man but
me and one other has set foot—rich in gold.”</p>

<p>“Where’s that other man?”</p>

<p>“Under the tundra ’long o’ the gold.”</p>

<p>She tried not to betray her interest. She even succeeded.
“And that’s the place you’re going up now to
work?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, I ain’t talked to folks about <em>that</em> place.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar waited to hear why.</p>

<p>But Blumpitty seemed to have no intention of enlightening
her. “The property we’re goin’ to work this
summer is the nineteen claims belongin’ to Blumpitty
&amp; Co., up on Glaysher Crick. They’re already located,
an’ recorded, an’ surveyed, an’ a year’s assessment
work done.”</p>

<p>“How much have people put into this company of
yours?”</p>

<p>“Right smart,” he said cryptically. “What with
my folks and my wife’s folks an’ our party—had to give
<em>them</em> a look in—only fair. But we’re goin’ to keep it
among ourselves ’s much as possible. They ain’t any of
us rich, not <em>now</em>, but”—he smiled a pale, pale smile all
to himself, that seemed to say the future was beyond
peradventure golden. “We all been workin’ people,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
said, grave again as ever. “But we’ve all saved a little
somethin’.”</p>

<p>“And you’re putting your savings into this?”</p>

<p>“Every cent. We know $250 put into Blumpitty &amp;
Co.’s this spring’ll be a thousand ’fore long.” Instead
of rejoicing, he sighed. “We’ve worked mighty hard,
but we got our chance now.” He rested on the thought
a moment. “They’s a fortune fur us up on Glaysher
Crick—’nough fur us all.” His pale eyes seemed inadvertently
to take in Mrs. Mar.</p>

<p>That lady presented her most baffling surface. Absolutely
nothing you could take hold of. Whether her
aspect discouraged Mr. Blumpitty or not, certainly he
seemed to have no more conversation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar was obliged herself to break the silence.
“So <em>you’re</em> pretty well satisfied, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Ya-as,” he said, “if only I can keep out o’ the hands
o’ the fy-nance-eers.”</p>

<p>“What’s to prevent you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess it’s all right”—but his look was dubious.
“I got a good many mouths to feed an’ a lot o’ developin’
to do.”</p>

<p>“You mean you haven’t got enough capital.” She
felt she had caught him. She was both disappointed and
rather relieved.</p>

<p>“I got <em>some</em> capital, like I told you. An’ I could get
plenty more if I wasn’t so afraid o’—” He paused, and
seemed to envisage afresh some subtle and merciless
foe. Mrs. Mar’s sharp eyes pecked him all over. If they
had left a mark wherever they had been, Blumpitty
would have presented no surface the size of a cent that
was not pitted as with virulent smallpox. It might well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
have inspired confidence that he bore up as well as he
did.</p>

<p>“What is it you’re ‘afraid’ of?” demanded Mrs. Mar.</p>

<p>“Losin’ personal control. But I’m all right s’ long ’s
I keep hold o’ fifty-one per cent. o’ the stock.”</p>

<p>“Why fifty-one per cent.?” She must understand this.</p>

<p>“So’s to have the decidin’ vote. So’s I can do the
directin’ myself. Watch it”—his pale eyes brooded—“an’
manage it, an’ make a reel success of it.” You got
the impression that the scheme was bound up not only
with his fortune but with his pride. “If I’m at the
head o’ the thing I can see that the ’riginal investors
don’t get froze out by the fy-nance-eers.”</p>

<p>“Well, haven’t you kept fifty-one per cent. of the
stock?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I got more’n that <em>now</em>. Blumpitty &amp; Co.’s
only jest started.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar had a moment’s thrill out of the sensation of
being there “at the start.” But she sternly repressed
any glimmer of betrayal. “I suppose,” she said, with an
intention of irony, “that you’re ready to let in a few
more private subscribers?”</p>

<p>“I’m in favor o’ lettin’ in one or two.” He fell into
thought undisturbed by Mrs. Mar’s silent pursuit, pecking
here, pecking there. “I wus thinkin’ I’d like your
daughter to have somethin’.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my daughter’s putting all she has into her
trip.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Blumpitty was doing some more thinking.
Gravely he brought out the result. “It ain’t many
young ladies would want to take that journey jest to
nurse their fathers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Mar looked at him coldly. “She hasn’t got anything
to invest in gold mines.” And then she was sorry
she had admitted this. If the man thought of Miss Mar—or,
say Mrs. Mar—as a probable investor, it might
make a difference.</p>

<p>But apparently quite unchilled, Mr. Blumpitty was
drawling, “Wa-al, if she comes with us, I could very
likely help her to locate a claim of her own.”</p>

<p>Even that handsome offer seemed not to “fetch”
Mrs. Mar.</p>

<p>And still he was not daunted. “I said to Mrs. Blumpitty,
‘That’s the kind o’ young lady I’d like to
help.’”</p>

<p>No sort of direct acknowledgment out of the young
lady’s mother. But presently, “Just at this juncture
I want to give my daughter all I can spare, or I
wouldn’t mind putting something into your company
myself.”</p>

<p>You might think he heard only the end of the sentence.
“It’s a good investment,” he said.</p>

<p>“It’s quite possible that <em>later</em>—” Mrs. Mar threw
in, feeling herself very diplomatic. “Just at present
the only funds I have in hand are what my eldest son
has sent to supplement his sister’s.”</p>

<p>“Ya-as, I wus thinking,” said Blumpitty, as though
in complete agreement, “when she buys her stuff at
Baumgarten’s she’d better get it through me, and then
she’ll pay only wholesale rates. That’ll be a savin’. I
could save her freight charges, too.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t she getting wholesale rates anyhow?”</p>

<p>“No. They won’t make no difference fur a little six
weeks’ order for one person. I’m gettin’ food and camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
outfit fur twenty-eight people fur two years. They
make a reduction fur that.”</p>

<p>It seemed reasonable; and really, these simple people
were disposed to be very serviceable.</p>

<p>She thought of Trenn’s brotherly letter of good-by
and his handsome contribution of $300, reposing at that
instant in the yellow bag that hung at her belt. Well,
suppose she used “the money for Hildegarde” in a
double sense. Suppose she got some stock in Hildegarde’s
name. It was all my eye about Blumpitty’s
wanting to help “that kind of young lady” just because
she—fudge! Mrs. Mar was “from Missouri!” But it
very probably <em>would</em> help the girl with her new friends
that they should look upon her as financially interested
in their enterprise—should think of her obliged and
grateful family as a probable source of further revenue.
Odd if it were Mrs. Mar after all who should be the cause
of the Mar family’s profiting by the gold discovery at
Nome. But she would do nothing upon impulse.</p>

<p>“I think I could send you two or three hundred before
you sail,” she said.</p>

<p>Mr. Blumpitty looked on the floor, and made no manner
of response.</p>

<p>“How would that do?” and she repeated the offer.</p>

<p>“I can’t promise they’ll be any o’ the margin left by
the time we sail.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Wa-al, I got to keep fifty-one per cent. fur myself.”</p>

<p>She’d heard all that. “How much a share is your
stock?”</p>

<p>“It’s only $25 now. But I guess it won’t ever be as
low again. This time next year—” He felt for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
watch. When he saw what time it was this year, slowly
he pulled his slack figure together and stood up.</p>

<p>“You’re going to wait—” began Mrs. Mar.</p>

<p>“I promised t’ meet a man about now.”</p>

<p>“Somebody who wants to join your company?” said
Mrs. Mar, with a pang.</p>

<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>“I <em>could</em> take twelve shares to start with, only—”</p>

<p>“I guess y’ better talk it over with y’ son.” Blumpitty
had stooped and was feeling under the chair for his
hat.</p>

<p>“It isn’t that,” said Mrs. Mar a little sharply, for the
idea of taking counsel with her son appealed to her much
less now that Blumpitty recommended it. “But I’m not
sure I won’t have to buy a second ticket for my daughter.”</p>

<p>“No danger o’ that.”</p>

<p>“And how do I know there’s a good berth left on
your steamer?”</p>

<p>“I got twenty-eight first-class accommodations. The
young lady can have the pick o’ them.” He seemed to
be coming slowly toward Mrs. Mar with a motion of
offering his hand, whether to reassure her as to the
solemnity of his given word on the subject of the berth,
or in mere good-by.</p>

<p>She arrested him with her eye. “If I get my daughter
these twelve shares”—Mrs. Mar’s hand was on the
yellow bag—“I do it on my own responsibility. I shall
not consult my sons.”</p>

<p>“Wa-al, it’s a good chance,” he admitted, but in the
tone of one not disposed to deny that “all flesh is grass.”
“I’d like your daughter to have her share. They ain’t
many young ladies would want to take that journey jest
to—”</p>

<p>“You’d better make out a receipt for those twelve
shares straight away, before anybody comes in and interrupts.”
Mrs. Mar opened the yellow bag.</p>

<p>Blumpitty looked vaguely at the floor. “I don’t know
as I got any blanks along.”</p>

<p>“Blanks! I don’t want any blanks.”</p>

<p>“Certificate forms.”</p>

<p>“Oh—well, look and see,” she said peremptorily, with
her glance at the clock.</p>

<p>Out of his breast pocket Blumpitty slowly took some
papers. “Only a dirty one,” he said sadly.</p>

<p>“Well, fill it out. There’s pen and ink on that
table.” She was counting bills on her lap.</p>

<p>Blumpitty stood vaguely looking round in a lost sort
of way, just as though time weren’t priceless and
Harry’s return at any moment likely to complicate, if
not checkmate, “the deal.”</p>

<p>“Here.” Mrs. Mar jumped up and put a chair in
front of the little writing-table. Then smartly she
tapped the silver-topped ink-bottle, as though she
doubted his having the sense to know what it was unless
she made some sort of demonstration in its neighborhood.
She even illustrated the fact that the lid lifted up.
Slowly Blumpitty had come over to the spindle-legged
table, and now sat in a heap in front of it, looking into
the ink. Mrs. Mar whisked a pen out of the rack and
pushed it into Blumpitty’s slow fingers. “And here in
this envelop is $300.” She took it out and counted it
over, under his dull eyes. “But I’ll keep it till Harry
comes back and says it’s all right about the ticket. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
can just exchange envelops without saying anything
further. Understand?” She felt a well-nigh irresistible
impulse to shake Blumpitty, but instead of doing that,
there she was signing a paper, after taking care to read
it twice, in spite of the pressure of time. And now,
although she still held both this document and the three
hundred dollars in her own hands, she was conscious of
qualms.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll be sinking a deal of good hard
money in that creek of yours this summer, whether you
get any out or not.”</p>

<p>“They’s plenty of work there,” he said, foggier than
ever, “but I got more’n that to do this summer.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>He looked at her with that curious sort of vagueness
that gives one an impression of hearing a man talk in
his sleep. You feel it would be unfair to hold him quite
responsible. “When I’ve got the work started all right
on Glaysher, I got to take two or three people I c’n trust
an’ go up to a place northwest o’ Nome.”</p>

<p>“What place?”</p>

<p>“Polaris.”</p>

<p>“What do you want to go there for, when you’ve got
nineteen claims to look after on Glacier—”</p>

<p>“Them nineteen claims is valyerble property, and
Blumpitty &amp; Co.’s goin’ to pay handsome dividends.
This time next year—”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want more than that?”</p>

<p>He paused, and then in that same somnambulist tone,
“I wusn’t lookin’ fur it,” he said, “I jest tumbled on
it.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>“A great big thing up by Polaris. Bigger’n anything
Blumpitty &amp; Co. have got on Glaysher. Bigger’n anything
any company’s got anywhere.”</p>

<p>Impossible to think a man boastful or even over-sanguine,
who spoke so wearily, with yellow-gray face so
unlit, with air and attitude so joyless. “It’ll make millionaires
of a good many people.”</p>

<p>There was silence in Jacob Dorn’s parlor. Mrs. Mar
had refused to credit a story of this sort once before.
Her unbelief had not only cost her a great fortune; it
had cost her happiness. She sat in silence, reflecting.
But she gave no sign.</p>

<p>“People have got so’s they don’t take much stock in
any feller’s talkin’ ’bout the Mother Lode. I don’t
blame ’em myself.”</p>

<p>“It turns out as stupid sometimes to be too skeptical
as to be too credulous,” quoth Mrs. Mar.</p>

<p>Mr. Blumpitty did not applaud the sentiment. He
looked sadly at the lady and then, as though the effort to
hold up his eyelids were too great, he rested his heavy
eyes on the silver rim of the ink-pot. “Everybody knows
they must <em>be</em> a Mother Lode some’ers around up there.”</p>

<p>“Why must there?”</p>

<p>“Wa-al, <em>I</em> don’t know,” said Blumpitty impartially.
“P’raps the gold come down from Heaven.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk nonsense.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it don’t come from Heaven, the gold they’re
findin’ at Nome an’ in the Klondike, and the noo camps—all
the loose placer gold o’ the North,” he reflected,
“if it ain’t come down from Heaven, it’s been washed
an’ weathered and glayshered out o’ some reef or range,
or great natchrul store-house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve read about that.”</p>

<p>He nodded faintly. “Ya-as, that’s what they all
say. Every man <em>believes</em> in a Mother Lode. But what
no man likes to believe is that another man’s found
her.”</p>

<p>Again silence.</p>

<p>Vivid description would have failed to picture for this
particular auditor what Blumpitty’s slow and clumsy
words conveyed as though by chance. So little did he
play the game in the usual way that Mrs. Mar felt the
satisfaction of the discoverer in getting at the story
through barriers and in despite of veils.</p>

<p>In the silence, up above—in Jacob Dorn’s sick chamber—some
one was heard opening the window.</p>

<p>“And you think,” Mrs. Mar spoke very low, “you
think you know where the Mother Lode is?”</p>

<p>“Pretty near every miner in the Northwest <em>thinks</em> he
knows.”</p>

<p>“You mean you are sure?”</p>

<p>“I’m forty-eight,” said Blumpitty mournfully.
“It’s twenty years since I liked sayin’ I was sure.”</p>

<p>“But” (he was the sort of man that needed reassuring)
“you’ve got good ground for believing—” She
waited.</p>

<p>“Last fall”—he looked round the red satin room as
though for possible haunts of eavesdroppers, and then
he further interrupted himself—“you mustn’t think
I found it myself,” he said modestly. “I got a tip—a
straight tip.”</p>

<p>“From the man that’s dead.”</p>

<p>“Ya-as. Leastways, they said he hadn’t more’n a
few days to live. Ya-as, dyin’ up there at Polaris!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Everybody in the camp knoo he’d struck it rich. Nobody
could find out where.”</p>

<p>“How did they know he’d struck—”</p>

<p>“Becuz he wus so secret about everything. Where
he’d come from. Where he wus goin’ if he got well,
and most of all”—Blumpitty looked round and sunk his
low voice—“where he got his nuggets and dust from.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he <em>had</em> nuggets—”</p>

<p>“Yes, nuggets and dust, too. Good and plenty.”</p>

<p>“He showed it to you?”</p>

<p>“No. He wus terrible secret about it. Terrible
afraid somebody’d rob him. Kind o’ sick you know
about it.” Slowly Blumpitty tapped his yellow-gray
forehead. “But he allowed he’d found something
worth while an’ he never let his bundle o’ dust out o’
sight. Day an’ night he kep’ it jest under his hand.
Everybody nosin’ around, tryin’ to be friends with him.
One day I wus passin’, an’ his dawg went fur me. I
picked up a stone. ‘Don’t y’ do it,’ he calls out o’ the
sod cabin, where he wus layin’ with the door open.
‘Don’t y’ do nothin’ to that dawg,’ he says. I explained
the dawg wus doin’ things to me. ‘Come in here,’ he
said, ‘an’ she won’t touch you.’ So I did, an’ we talked
a while.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“He asked me kind o’ sarcastic, was I ‘lookin’ fur the
Mother Lode?’ I said I guessed I wusn’t no different
from other men, except that I wusn’t hangin’ round a
sick man fur to get his secrets out o’ him. ‘No,’ he said,
‘I ain’t never seen you hangin’ round.’ An’ then he
told me.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>“I says, ‘I’m figurin’ on findin’ the Mother Lode up
in them hills yonder.’ ‘That’s right,’ he said, an’ his
eyes wus kind o’ wild an’ glassy. ‘Up over yonder?’ I
said. ‘Yes,’ says he; ‘up North. That’s where the
Mother Lode is.’ An’ I think from what he said, he’d
called his discovery-claim ‘The Lode Star.’”</p>

<p>“What made you think—”</p>

<p>“Course he wus kind o’ queer—out of his head, y’
know, fur he called it the ‘Mother Lode Star.’ An’ he
wus terrible secret about it. All the time gettin’ away
from the subject and talkin’ about the dawg.”</p>

<p>“Well—”</p>

<p>“Wa-al, they wusn’t more’n half a dozen people at
Polaris then, an’ nobody’d found anything to make a
boom out of. But they all hung on. And they made
presents to that feller, took him grub regillar. An’
other folks kep’ comin’ jest becuz that man wus there.
An’ they all knoo he’d struck it rich. An’ they all
knoo he wus dyin’. That was what they wus waitin’
for. I didn’t wait, even them few days they said he
had to live. The snow wus beginning t’ fly an’ I had
to go back to Glaysher and get Mrs. Blumpitty an’ our
party out before navigation closed. But I said to myself,
‘I’ll risk it—fur the Mother Lode!’ An’ I did.
Went up over the hills to the north, in a bee line from
that cabin o’ his till I come ter—” Blumpitty’s voice
dropped still lower and he hesitated, while, like one who
scarce dares move lest he break some spell, slowly he
looked round, and seemed to forget how to turn back.
He remained so, sitting awry, listening.</p>

<p>“It’s only some one moving about in Mr. Dorn’s
room overhead. You found the Mother Lode?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>He found he was able to twist himself back by dint of
drawing out his watch. “When I get t’ thinkin’ about
it I clean forget the time.” He stood up. “I guess I
got t’ be goin’.”</p>

<p>Footsteps and low subdued voices in the hall. Hildegarde
had seen her brother from an upper window, and
had come down with Mrs. Blumpitty to let Harry in.</p>

<p>There would be no trouble in selling “Berth 21” for
the third time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mar, about to hand an envelop to Mr. Blumpitty,
wondered to herself, “How much of a fool am I? Well,
I haven’t done fool-things all along the line, like most
people. If I must commit foolishness before I die,
I’ll do it all in a lump and be done with it.” Whereupon
she handed Mr. Blumpitty the envelop. He
seemed to be giving Harry his address. Mrs. Blumpitty
was making an appointment to meet Miss Mar “at ten
o’clock to-morrow, at Baumgarten’s.”</p>

<p>For the third time Mrs. Mar was reading through a
paper she held in her hand. When she came to the ill-written
signature, “How do you spell your name?” she
demanded of Mr. Blumpitty.</p>

<p>“B-l-u-m-p-i-t-t-y,” said the gentleman mournfully.</p>

<p>“Humph,” said Mrs. Mar, head on one side and eyes
fixed so critically on the name that Mrs. Blumpitty
hastened to the defense. “It’s French,” says she.</p>

<p>“French!” echoes Mrs. Mar. “How do you make
that out?”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what his grandmother always told him.
She said it was originally Blank Peed.” Wherewith,
having vindicated the family, she shook hands and led
the way out. Harry was opening the outside door for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
them. No one spoke above a whisper, on account of
Mr. Dorn.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Mr. Blumpitty.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Look here”—Mrs. Mar detained him for a last aside—“you’ve
got twenty-eight people to see after, and a
company to manage, and nineteen claims to develop,
why can’t you be content with that?”</p>

<p>He looked at her. “Would you be?” he asked simply.</p>

<p>Her face told tales. “You mean”—she hesitated—“if
I’d got on the track of the Mother Lode?”</p>

<p>“Jest so,” said Blumpitty, and slowly he followed his
wife out of the Great Importer’s house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-h.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Hildegarde learned other things the next
morning besides how to do your marketing
for two years in an hour. She brought
away from Baumgarten’s the renewed impression
that Mrs. Blumpitty was a person
of some practical sense, and that Mr. Blumpitty, though
he might be an authority upon the Mother Lode and an
estimable character to boot, did in reality himself need a
good deal of looking after. It is impossible to say just how
the “unlogical” feminine mind—in this case young and
ignorant as well—may arrive at so definite a conclusion
out of a small assemblage of apparently trifling data.
For Hildegarde’s judgment was not founded merely
upon the outer man. Nor was it contributed to very
largely by Mr. Blumpitty’s indifference to small economies,
as shown in his readiness to order gallons of expensive
“olive” when cotton-seed oil was as cheap as
wholesome to cook with, and Mr. Blumpitty convicted
by his wife of inability to detect any difference in taste.
It was not merely that Mrs. Blumpitty was the one to
offer reasons why methylated spirit, though cheap on
the bill, was dearer in actual use than alcohol. It was
not that he had forgotten after sixteen months’ experience,
“what a cravin’ you get up there fur sweet and
fur sour,” and what a failure the California dried fruit
had turned out the year before. <em>Had</em> he complained he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
couldn’t eat such insipid stuff till Mrs. Blumpitty had
“livened” it with a dash of vinegar as well as sugar and
spice? Wa-al, p’raps he had!</p>

<p>“You mustn’t give me dried apples from any place
nearer here than Michigan,” said Mrs. Blumpitty.</p>

<p>The Baumgarten Brother had smiled a little, and said,
“She knows.”</p>

<p>The upshot of the morning was to give Hildegarde an
inkling that the chief use of Mr. Blumpitty, so far as she
was concerned, might be that he would keep her family
soothed by the illusion that this respectable man, pledged
to her service, was “going to see that everything was all
right.” For the rest, should she not perhaps do well to
imitate his spouse, and not expect any one to be wide
awake in her interest who was half asleep before his
own? Although he had said, “Ya-as, it’s all right
about the ticket,” Miss Mar interviewed the steamship
people on her own behalf. “Quite right!” they indorsed
Mr. Blumpitty’s account of the matter. And as
to the berths, Mr. Blumpitty already had twenty-eight,
and had sent word he wanted a twenty-ninth, “a pertickler
good one fur a lady.” “Noospaper woman I
presoom,” said the agent politely. It seemed to be only
the press that inspired such respect. She was more glad
than ever of the offer that had come that morning from
Eddie Cox, editor, now, of the “San Miguel Despatch.”
“Yes,” she told the agent, “I am to be a Regular Correspondent.”
In all sorts of ways she saw her status
incomparably improved by falling in with Eddie Cox’s
suggestion. It appeared to be necessary to stand well
with a “noospaper” woman. “What accommodation
can I have?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, the best we got.”</p>

<p>“Is there much choice?”</p>

<p>“We put you down here, with Mr. Blumpitty’s
party.” A number was indicated.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see the cabin.”</p>

<p>“<em>See</em> it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, before I decide.”</p>

<p>Impossible. If she didn’t take and pay for the berth
now, in an hour it would be in other hands. But seeing
her quite unhustled by this horrid alternative, the agent
said he would make a great, an unheard-of exception in
her case, and promised to take her over the ship as soon
as the <i>Los Angeles</i> came up from Tacoma, where she was
being elaborately refitted, “new paint, electric light,
everything.” It would be a pity for a “noospaper”
woman to go in any meaner vessel.</p>

<p>The crowds that composed the sailing list besieged the
offices day by day, wildly impatient at the date of departure
being “a little postponed” while the <i>Los Angeles</i>
was further embellished for their reception.
“Style’s all very well. But gettin’ there’s the thing.”</p>

<p>And among them this girl, with only half her ticket
paid for, coming in twice a day to keep track of events.</p>

<p>At last, after a night of riot, when the office was very
nearly pulled about the company’s ears, all Seattle
knew that the much-heralded steamer had been brought
up from Tacoma and was at the Seattle wharf. The
crowds on the water front could see her, glaring and
white and respect-inspiring, but guarded like the gate
of Paradise.</p>

<p>“Let’s go and see our quarters,” Hildegarde suggested,
meeting Mr. Blumpitty in the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wish we could,” said Blumpitty sadly. “No one
allowed aboard till sailin’ time, nine o’clock to-morrer.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde spoke of the agent’s promise.</p>

<p>“Promise! Oh, yes, promise anything.” And Blumpitty
moved gloomily away in the crowd.</p>

<p>Hildegarde found the agent without loss of time. He
was overwhelmed with work. Didn’t she see!</p>

<p>What she saw was a clay-faced individual, with a
slight bulge in one lean jaw where he stored his tobacco—red-eyed,
unwashed, and obviously irritated by her reappearance.
His promise—quietly she insisted. The
anæmic visage twitched, and he attended to another customer.
But she stood waiting, and she looked as if she
were prepared to camp there till she’d had her way.
Oh, these women! They wus always like that—fussin’
and naggin’ and goin’ on!</p>

<p>He attended to two other customers. <em>They</em> didn’t
expect such things of him. But there she still stood
with her eyes fixed upon the agent, blockin’ up the way,
waitin’, waitin’. “What’d I do if they all expected me
to go runnin’ round the wharves with ’em!” he demanded
in an angry undertone.</p>

<p>“You promised,” she began, glancing at the fact that
there were three other clerks in the office.</p>

<p>“Mr. Blumpitty’s satisfied!” he said severely, pointing
out the lamentable contrast. And he’d taken her for a
lady. A lady would believe a gentleman when he told
her it was all right—and not worry him. But though
she must have seen plainly how she was still further
lowering the agent’s lofty ideal of how a lady should behave,
there she stood looking at him with a grave steadiness
that held no hope of her yielding her point. “Promise!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
promise!”—why, it was damned good-natured of
him to make a promise, but to expect him to— He bent
toward her. “Look yere,” he said in an angry whisper,
“I ain’t got a special permit yet.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait till you get it.”</p>

<p>“Can’t have it yere before three.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I’ll come at three, but you must please
not disappoint me again, or else I—” He jerked away.
As he saw her going out—Now what did she mean?—“or
else she—” You never know what pull these noospaper
women have got.</p>

<p>He had forgotten all about her when— O Lor!
There she was upon the stroke, like fate.</p>

<p>Well, well, did she promise not to tell none o’ the rest
o’ the passengers? All right, then. Come ahead.</p>

<p>He led the way to the docks with every circumstance
of secrecy; dodging through back streets, lying to acquaintances
as to where he was going, and gradually
growing cheerfuller, pausing to exchange humorous
asides with friends along the wharf. Hildegarde, waiting,
silent, patient, during these passages, was entirely
aware of the curious looks bent upon her, and saw that
her expedition with this little rat of a man was held by
some to have a “larky” aspect (save the mark!). She
saw it was incredible to these people that the agent
should take this trouble for any other reason than that
she was an attractive young woman who had smiled
upon this poor little drink-sodden creature, and was
giving him the rare sensation of being “a sad dog with
the ladies.” Even playing at the idea had quite transformed
the agent. Poor little misery! She knew instinctively
she had nothing to fear from him, and even
if he had been a different type she had no doubt but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
what she would have known how to keep him in his place
when they were alone. But before these pals of his the
agent put on sly looks, carried himself rakishly, and
tipped his hat very far back on his head. Well, it was
an odd world evidently, but Hildegarde Mar had come
out to see it. Now, after various formalities, they were
going on board.</p>

<p>“See! paint’s wet yet. That’s why I didn’t want y’
to come. Spoil y’ clo’es, sure ’s a gun.” Apparently to-morrow
the paint would be dry as a bone. Past the
strangely few decent, though cramped, state-rooms of the
first saloon, each ticketed with the names of prospective
occupants, down into the dim region of the second saloon,
down into the intermediate, further down, clinging
on to ladders, down, down, into the bowels of the ship,
Hildegarde and the ferret-faced agent went, looking for
Mr. Blumpitty’s quarters. And lo! though that gentleman
had paid for first-class accommodation—as the agent
admitted—he’d been “glad to get the only accommodation
left,” and that was in the hold! The twenty-nine
berths were twenty-nine sections of deal shelves, ranged
in tiers five deep, and set so close one on top of the other
you could not believe it possible for a good-sized man to
insert his body between the unsheeted ticking of his
chuck-mattress and the board above his head. Hildegarde
stood stooping in the awful hole and staring as one
not crediting her eyes.</p>

<p>“It’ll look better,” says the agent, a little shamefaced,
“when the beds are made. The company supplies
a piller each, and a pair o’ blankets.”</p>

<p>No ventilation. No light of day. One electric burner
to illumine the horror of the gloom.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say—” began Hildegarde, turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
such a look upon the agent that he said hurriedly:
“No, no. This won’t do for a noos—fur a lady.” And
they climbed the ladders back to day.</p>

<p>He found the lady up-stairs quarters on the saloon deck.</p>

<p>“But there are only five berths here.”</p>

<p>“Best cabin on the ship,” said he, spitting with decision
through the port.</p>

<p>“But on this card on the door there are five names
already.”</p>

<p>“One’s comin’ out,” and he saw to that by the simple
process of drawing an indelible pencil across “Miss
Tillie Jump,” and substituting “Miss H. Mar.”</p>

<p>Still the young lady studied the card. “Look at
this.”</p>

<p>He looked.</p>

<p>“Here, at the very top.”</p>

<p>“Don’t see nothin’.”</p>

<p>“You don’t see <em>Mr.</em> and Mrs. David M. Jones.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I see them.”</p>

<p>“Surely that’s a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Mistake? No. I ’tended to them folks myself.”
As the young lady stared incredulous, he reassured her.
“They’re comin’ all right. Tip-top folks. He wus
governor of—”</p>

<p>“They’re not coming in here?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“<em>Mr.</em> Jones?”</p>

<p>“Yes, David M. He wus governor of—”</p>

<p>“In here, with all these—ladies!”</p>

<p>“Well, one’s his wife. Don’t you be afraid. <em>He’s</em>
all right.”</p>

<p>“He can’t possibly come in here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s got to. No other place. Him an’ his wife wus
almost the first passengers on the list.”</p>

<p>“Well, give them a cabin to themselves.”</p>

<p>“Oh, see here! There ain’t room fur no style like
that on <em>this</em> trip.”</p>

<p>“Then put back Miss Jump and take out Mr. Jones.”</p>

<p>She saw the agent blink at such cool juggling. “Mr.
Jones must go in a man’s cabin,” she explained.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know they’re all full?”</p>

<p>“He can’t come in here,” said the young lady inflexibly.</p>

<p>“He’s got to, that’s all there is about it. I can’t go
playin’ no monkey tricks with David M. Jones.”</p>

<p>“Then please find me some other place.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t I already told you? They ain’t no—”</p>

<p>“You mean you can’t, after all, accommodate me on
this ship?”</p>

<p>“Lord! Lord!” The agent seemed to pray for patience
and for light.</p>

<p>“You were prepared to make Miss Tillie Jump—”
and in spite of herself, gravity went by the board. But
the agent’s smile was wan.</p>

<p>“That was different,” he assured her. “Well, here
goes!” With the air of one who has cast the last shred
of prudence to the winds, he wrote out a new card from
which you might gather that David M. Jones had not
been reëlected for this berth. And so, exit the former
governor!</p>

<p>“<em>Now</em> you can’t say we ain’t done everything.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Hildegarde. “There’s only one
thing more. I should like to bring my steamer trunk in
to-day and get settled.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>The agent gaped, and then, with a gesture of comic
feebleness before the spectacle presented by this young
lady, he sat down on the edge of the berth labeled, “T.
Jump,” and grinned.</p>

<p>“The paint’s nearly dry up here,” urged Miss Mar,
as one meeting the only possible objection.</p>

<p>It must be because she was on a “noospaper.” Nothing
else could give a woman a nerve like this. Well, it
was positively refreshin’! Out of pure gaiety of heart
the agent added a little new tobacco to the store already
accumulated in his cheek. “’Tain’t a bad idear,” he
said. “More’n you’d like to try it on. But it wouldn’t
hardly do.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Make a nawful rumpus.” As still she seemed not to
understand the enormity of her proposal. “’Twouldn’t
be fair to let some and not let others.”</p>

<p>She could see that. “But why not let them all?”</p>

<p>“Oh, haw! haw!” The thing was somehow deliciously
comic. But a compromise might be possible—“fur
a noos—” Luckily the purser happened to be on
deck. Hildegarde, to her stark astonishment, heard the
agent reply confidentially to some question, “Well, y’
wouldn’t think so, but from one or two things she let
drop, I guess she’s one o’ ——’s hustlers, an’ special
correspondent fur the ‘New York Herald,’ I guess, an’
Gawd knows what else.” She was forthwith presented
to Mr. Brown, and it was arranged that the “noospaper”
woman should send her baggage down to the
purser’s care, and herself be allowed to come on board
a couple of hours before the mob—say at seven o’clock
in the evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb">At a quarter before that hour the street near the wharf
where the <i>Los Angeles</i> lay was dense with packed humanity.
So much time and tact it took to worm one’s
way through the mass, that Madeleine, who had come
down to see her friend off, began to despair. Already
she had been longer away from her invalid than she
had meant. Hildegarde urged her to turn back now.
Madeleine looked about with anxious eyes. “It’s
worse even than I imagined. It’s terrible to leave you
here.”</p>

<p>“It’s much more terrible for you to leave Mr. Dorn.”</p>

<p>Madeleine didn’t deny that.</p>

<p>“And if you come further there’s no telling <em>when</em>
you’ll get out. It will be worse going back against the
tide.”</p>

<p>But Madeleine hesitated, with harassed face.</p>

<p>“I’d much rather you went now,” Hildegarde urged,
taking her suit-case from her friend. “Good-by.”</p>

<p>Madeleine clung to her with filling eyes. “I <em>hate</em>
leaving you.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde kissed her. “Good-by, dear. And thank
you a thousand times.”</p>

<p>In the act of going, Madeleine whispered, “Oh, I <em>hope</em>
nothing will happen to you. But I’m frightened to
death. Good-by. Oh <em>dear</em>!”</p>

<p>And that was the last of the old familiar life.</p>

<p class="tb">As slowly Hildegarde got herself and her suit-case
through the crowd, it was borne in upon her that perhaps
she had been wrong to insist that neither of her
brothers should come and see her off, as each had nobly
suggested, in spite of their unwavering opposition to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
enterprise. She had made a point of their trusting her
“to do it alone.”</p>

<p>Besides, she wasn’t alone. In every letter she flourished
the Blumpittys. Where were those Blumpittys
now? No sign of them since yesterday. Anyhow, she
had prevented the boys from coming. Her fear, not of
course formulated to them, had been that if they came,
somehow, at the last moment they would try to prevent
her going. Well—she looked about—they probably
would. She pressed on, inwardly exulting, outwardly
modest and asking pardon. And all the time she kept a
sharp lookout, as if, in spite of everything, she was expecting
some one. A Blumpitty? Not a bit of it.</p>

<p class="tb">“It’s no use,” said a red-faced man, with a wheezy
voice, “not a <em>bit</em> o’ use yer tryin’ to get through yere.”</p>

<p>“There would be,” said the young lady, “if you
helped me a little.”</p>

<p>That was different. But, “Ye’ll only get to stand a
yard or two further on till nine o’clock. They wouldn’t
open them gates fur President McKinley.”</p>

<p>“I want to see if my baggage got here all right. I
sent it hours and hours ago.”</p>

<p>“Same bright idear’s occurred to the rest of us,” said
a sharp-faced youth. But they let the young lady pass.
And in the uncertain light they looked after the tall,
striking figure, dressed in close-fitting dark green, wearing
a perfectly plain green felt hat, which was somehow
more distinguishable and more distinguished set upon a
head like that than if it had been furbelowed after the
fashion of the other feminine headgear that flowered and
feathered in the throng. Public opinion would have set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
her down as “stuck up,” from the way she carried herself,
had it not been for something too gentle in the face
to support that view. The delicately molded chin,
with the end softly turned up, gave an almost childish
look to the face, and the long-lashed eyes, at once eager
and abstracted, why were they always looking, looking?
“Lost her party, I guess.”</p>

<p>On she went, changing her suit-case from one tired
hand to the other, looking here, looking there, just as she
had done in the Seattle streets. She had gone about all
these last days consciously braced for a final encounter
with Cheviot—a last attempt on his part to make her
abandon the undertaking. That, of course, was the reason
he had not written, nor even telegraphed, to say
good-by. There was nothing surly, or even sullen, about
Cheviot. Though they had parted “like that,” he
wouldn’t be willing she should go without his making
some sign. Not having done so could only mean—Oh,
she knew what it meant.</p>

<p>She dramatized the coming scene—saw herself being
“quite firm,” defeating, utterly routing him. But in
order to carry out the program she mustn’t let him take
her by surprise. And as now over this shoulder, now
over that, she scrutinized the faces in the crowd, she
felt her heart beat as she thought of the coming conflict.
And the pink color rose in her face. She had
been afraid “the boys” might want to turn her back.
In her heart of hearts she was afraid that Louis, in
some way not clearly foreseen, would succeed. She
went forward with the sense of one escaping from a
definite peril. At last, rather out of breath, she dropped
her suit-case before the door of the brightly lighted baggage-room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Just inside was a man in his shirt-sleeves,
and beyond him—</p>

<p>“<em>There’s</em> my trunk!” she cried out, with the cheerful
air of one descrying a valued friend.</p>

<p>“Want it checked?”</p>

<p>“Yes, please.”</p>

<p>“Where’s it goin’?”</p>

<p>“To Nome, of course,” answered Hildegarde, panting
a little and straightening her hat. “Nobody is going
anywhere else, are they?” she added, a little impatient
at the man’s staring and delay.</p>

<p>“N-no. I guess not. But—” He grinned good-humoredly.
“I didn’t think you looked like a Nomer.”</p>

<p>Here was a blow at the very start. Hildegarde
glanced down at her plain clothes, and decided the man
was mistaken. But he checked her trunk, her provision-box,
her bag, her deck-chair, and her roll of wraps, and
she, declining to give up the suit-case, turned about to
make her way among the people, massed thicker than
ever in this direction. For over yonder, hidden by the
crowd, was the gate whose opening would give access to
the <i>Los Angeles</i>. Progress here more difficult than ever.</p>

<p>Courage! Now if Louis were somewhere in the crush,
if those critical blue-gray eyes were on her, he would be
wondering to see how well she made her way, keeping
her footing and her temper, gaining inch by inch her
goal. She went the more unflinching as under the gray-blue
eye. When it became obvious that this pink and
white gentle-looking girl was intent, if you please, on
working her way to the barrier in front of people who
had been there an hour, she was treated to an experience
of unyielding backs, sharp elbows, and surly looks. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
shouldn’t she wait her turn? Yes, Hildegarde reflected,
it was natural they should feel that, especially the
women. Why, how many women there were! But no
Mrs. Blumpitty, and no— Hildegarde looked at her
watch. How the time had flown. It really was rather
odd about Cheviot. He might, of course, come still later,
but suppose he didn’t. It was almost incredible, and
yet—</p>

<p>If he did come, he’d see, at all events, there were some
quite nice-seeming women here. But perhaps they weren’t
going. This one, with the white, white face under the
orange hat—what little young voice was that beside her?
Why, the woman was holding a boy by the hand. He
reminded Hildegarde of Cheviot’s small nephew, Billy.
She smiled down into the solemn little face. “Are you
seeing some one off?”</p>

<p>“Nop!” said the Curlyhead sturdily. “Goin’ to
Nome meself.” And the crowd cheered. Either that
demonstration frightened him, or he was tired and
indifferent to popular approval. He began to fret and
then to whimper. Was it his father who spoke so roughly
and so thickly? Curlyhead’s whimper blossomed into
wailing. His father began to shake him.</p>

<p>“Oh, wait a minute,” said the tall young lady, as if
meaning only to delay the operation for a second. She
set down the suit-case on her own toes, and out of a
pocket in the close-fitting green jacket came a cake of
chocolate, all glorious in silver foil. Hildegarde held it
before the child’s distorted little face. The features
righted themselves as by magic. The youngest pioneer
no longer took a gloomy view of his prospects.</p>

<p>The father’s been drinking heavily, Hildegarde said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
to herself as she went on. Poor wife. Poor little boy.
She would know Curlyhead better on the ship.</p>

<p>How strange if Louis were to harbor such deep resentment
as not to write and not to appear. That <em>he</em> should
be the only one of her familiar circle that had not to be
dissuaded from coming to see her off! If suddenly now
in the crowd she should see him she would be almost
glad. After all, he couldn’t prevent her sailing. What
was he thinking of to let her go off like this, without—Had
her mother been right? Just then a woman, in a
sealskin jacket and with diamonds twinkling in her ears,
not only refused flatly to let Hildegarde pass but angrily
admonished the men about her to stand firm.</p>

<p>The tall young lady only changed her course a little,
and made obliquely for the barrier, but the encounter
with that woman affected her more unpleasantly than
the elbowing and jostling of the others. She had a distinct
vision of Louis Cheviot’s face as he had said “the
kind of woman that goes to Nome.” It had been horrible
to him that Hildegarde was not daunted. For she
hadn’t let him see that she was. And now that woman,
with the hard face and the diamond ear-rings!—and
Louis too disgusted to want to come and see his old
friend off, or even to send her a message of good-by.</p>

<p>She began to see how foolish it was to expect to see
him here. He had washed his hands of her.</p>

<p>And still, in the back of her head, she thought he
might come—even built upon it. She looked back. No,
he wasn’t in sight; but a tall, grizzled man had given
the youngest pioneer a seat on his shoulder. That was
nice of the grizzled man.</p>

<p>But it was saddening to go on so great a journey without
the good-will of so close a friend as—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>There was something very hard about Louis. He
could enjoy himself quite comfortably, since he had
washed his hands of her. Her mother—(why was
this man in front of her dressed in oilskins?) Yes—washed
his hands of her. Her mother had told her as
much. Bella and Mrs. Wayne had come up from the
country to the Valdivia G. H. Charity Ball. They had
stayed at the great new hotel. Bella had worn pink at
the ball, and danced constantly with Louis Cheviot. She
stayed on for several days, and they drove together every
evening. People had begun to talk. Well, it had
seemed very possible once. Why not? And here was
Hildegarde actually expecting he might have left Bella
and come all that way from Valdivia just to wish Hildegarde
God-speed on a journey he had loathed the very
mention of. Idiocy. Of course he was out driving with
Bella this soft, beautiful evening. He would be thinking:
“Bella could never do anything so unfeminine as to go
to a horrible place like Nome!” Bella and Louis. Why
did she, the girl struggling here in the crowd, feel this
half-incredulous aching at the thought? Bella and
Louis. Natural enough. Even inevitable. The reason
that she, Hildegarde, felt like this was that she wasn’t
accustomed yet to being alone, and it was so hard to
reach the barrier yonder. Jack Galbraith. Would he,
too, join them—the sensible stay-at-home folk? Curiously,
Jack was grown as dim as last year’s dreams. For
weeks she had felt him fading out of the old picture.
And in the new he had no place at all. Why was
that? Perhaps he was dead. It seemed hardly to matter.
Should she ever get to the barrier?</p>

<p>Oh, how they pushed and crowded upon her. It made
her feel quite angry. Not so much with these poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
struggling people. But with Cheviot. If he were here
now, instead of driving about with Bella, if those broad
shoulders of his were between Hildegarde and— “Oh,
please, please, you’re crushing me.”</p>

<p>“Then stand back,” said a man angrily.</p>

<p><em>And he wasn’t even drunk.</em></p>

<p>Over an hour it had taken her to penetrate from the
outer fringes of the crowd, by way of the baggage-room,
to this gate in the barrier, chained and barred. On the
other side of it, an irate dragon on guard, ready to
breathe fire and brimstone at the mere notion of letting
anybody by. When Hildegarde signed to him, he only
roared out over the heads of the people, “Nine o’clock’s
the time everybody was told to come on board. If
you don’t like waitin’ outside till the proper time you
can go home.” Hildegarde tried to convey across the
barrier that she was acting under instructions. “Keep
back,” roared the dragon, quite as if he feared the tall
figure might contemplate vaulting over.</p>

<p>“It is a special arrangement,” she said quite low,
“made by the purser himself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, very likely.”</p>

<p>“I assure you the purser—”</p>

<p>“God A’mighty, what purser?”</p>

<p>Still Hildegarde spoke as confidentially as possible.
“The purser of this ship.”</p>

<p>“What’s the name o’ the purser who could do a thing
like that?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Brown is his name.”</p>

<p>“Brown ain’t the name o’ the purser o’ this ship.
Guess again!”</p>

<p>The crowd exulted. The dodge had failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>“Isn’t this the <i>Los Angeles</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, by—!” A gush of oaths before which the girl
gasped as if a bowl of ice-cold water had been, dashed in
her face. “Oh-h!—if Louis heard that! Luckily he will
never know. He’s out driving with Bella.”</p>

<p>She took her courage in both hands. “I shall report
you if you don’t let me by. Your own agent introduced
me to the <i>Los Angeles</i> purser, and called him Mr.
Brown.”</p>

<p>“Purser, purser”—more blasphemy—“I wouldn’t
let the <em>owner</em> of this ship on board before nine o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Brown said—”</p>

<p>“Brown! Brown!” shouted the man, goaded to
frenzy by this feminine obstinacy. “Look yere, if he
was Black and the devil himself I wouldn’t let ye in
after the orders I’ve had.”</p>

<p>The crowd chuckled and swayed.</p>

<p>The tall girl craned her neck over the barrier in the
uncertain light. She had caught sight of a lurking figure
uncommonly like the fat purser’s, seeming to seek shelter
behind a bale of merchandise. “Why, there he is now,”
she said quite low. “Mr. Brown!” No answer, and the
figure vanished. “Mr. Brown!” she called, in a clear,
penetrating voice. “I’m here, as you told me to be.
Mr. B—”</p>

<p>Hurriedly the tun-bellied figure reappeared and whispered
to the dragon. A brief low-voiced altercation between
the two men. Only one word distinguishable to
the girl on the other side of the barrier, “noospaper.”
A growling menace of “trouble sure” from the dragon,
and then the gate opened a cautious crack. The noospaper
woman and her suit-case were plucked from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
murmuring crowd and set upon the ship. She turned to
thank her rescuer. For all his amplitude he had melted
into air. On the far side of the barrier, under the electric
light, the crowd murmured and swayed, coupling
the name of Brown with opprobrium.</p>

<p>The ship was badly lit and silent as the grave. Hildegarde
felt her way down into the saloon, where a single
light was burning. She found her cabin, and she put
a jacket and a suit-case in her berth. On reflection, to
make it look the more occupied, she added a green felt
hat with her card stuck in the narrow band. Then out
into the dim saloon. How strange for her to be in this
place. So strange, she had a fleeting notion she would
presently wake up and find herself in the little white
room at home. But no, for the purser, who appeared
and disappeared like some incorporeal essence, was
standing at the door of the saloon with a pile of letters
and telegrams, and little packets, saying: “There’s
flowers, too, an’ a box o’ fruit an’ a basket. When the
steward comes, I’ll send them to your room.”</p>

<p>Last letters from the few who had been allowed to
know the name of her ship, from her mother and the
boys, from Bella, from Eddie Cox—no one had forgotten
her except— He might come yet. Even Bella’s mother
had sent a telegram, saying she hoped Hildegarde would
find the traveling tea-basket a slight solace. Bella sent
fruit, and wrote: “Come back as much the same Hildegarde
as you can. You won’t be quite the same I know.
No one is after a great journey. Too much happens. No,
I shan’t ever see you again, dearest of all my friends,
but let the Hildegarde that you bring home be as much
like the old Hildegarde as you can manage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>These letters, the last echo of the old voices. Why did
she hear plainest of all the one who was silent.</p>

<p>What was this! Homesick already, and the anchor
not yet weighed?</p>

<p>She would go on deck. At the foot of the companionway
she took heart of grace, breathing in gratefully the
whiff of fresh air that came down to greet her. But half-way
up she paused. What was that—that sound like the
deep groundswell of the sea? Why, that must be the
crowd—those people on the other side of the barrier and
the ever-augmenting legions all along the water front.
It was the sharp-featured youth, with the shifty little
eyes, who had called her wish to check her baggage “a
brilliant idear”; it was the drunken man who had
shaken his little tired child; the woman with the white,
white face; that other woman with the ear-rings, who
hated anybody who went in front of her—all the people
who had jostled and elbowed and tried to force her back.
Soon they would be here, her daily companions. No
escape. They were to become as familiar as people she
had known all her life, as those home people who already
seemed as far off as the dead folk are. But the home
people weren’t dead; they were driving and dancing,
and they had nothing more in common with Hildegarde
Mar. She was henceforth to be companioned by that
hungry crowd out there, with its vague murmuring, like
the sea at Monterey. Dancing and merrymaking fell
back into that far-off world that she had left so long
ago, before she came all by herself to Seattle, all by herself
was setting sail for Nome. Even when she reached
the top of the companionway the noises on the wharf still
sounded muffled for the most part and seemed to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
from afar. But every now and then a single anger-sharpened
note—or a cheer it might be—went up into the
still air as startling as a rocket, and like a rocket seemed
to burst in that higher region and come falling down to
earth in a shower of sharp broken cries and strange,
unnerving noises. She remembered the man who had
set the child on his shoulder, and a woman with gray
hair. She seemed to see them trampled under foot. The
woman in the sealskin jacket looked on. Something
menacing even in the muted cries, as though they presaged
some mighty uprising of a trampled people. Had
there been sounds like these abroad in Paris streets in
the days of the Revolution? The solitary girl lent herself
for a moment to that terror of the mob which dimly
feels that no physical danger on the earth can match the
peril you may stand in before the fury of the mass. Any
single creature, however angry or debased, is a human
being. But the mass!—the mass is a monster, and the
monster was at the gate.</p>

<p>Along the deserted deck she went, making hardly any
noise, and listening with tense nerves.</p>

<p>How strange for her to be in this place alone.</p>

<p>Oh, Louis! Louis! and suddenly she had stopped. She
was leaning her head against a stanchion, and the tears
were running down her face.</p>

<p>But very soon she was ashamed.</p>

<p>Drying her eyes, she went aft on the upper deck. The
air was soft and wooing. All the harbor full of shipping;
and lights—lights everywhere. The arch of heaven
was very wide and filled with an infinite dusk. It was
like some soothing and benignant presence. She faced
about, still looking up, and saw the keen little crescent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of the young moon hanging aslant, seeming to bend down
over the <i>Los Angeles</i>. The sight of the little moon comforted
the girl curiously. It seemed to be shining so
hopefully, so gallantly, setting its tiny horns for a signal
just over Hildegarde’s ship. She turned a silver
coin in her pocket while she wished, and in the dusk she
curtsied to her Moonship. Feeling a little less forlorn
after performance of these rites, she walked the silent
deck with firmer step and the hornèd moon for company,
trying not to listen to those sounds down there upon the
wharf—trying to recapture her early zest in this enterprise.
Now there were dim figures moving about the
shadowy deck, and in the smoking-room a light was
turned on. Through the window she could see a group
of four men. They stood before a big sheet of paper
laid upon the table, and they argued some point with
anger. Why, one of the men was the little agent! “I
swear it’s all right”—he raised his voice excitedly—“all
quite regillar an’ legal.”</p>

<p>A snigger near where the girl stood made her aware
of the presence of two men behind her there in the dusk,
one indifferent, half turned away; the other, through
spectacles that caught the smoking-room light, looked in
over Hildegarde’s shoulder at the angry group.</p>

<p>“What are they arguing so about?” asked the girl, a
little anxiously. If either of the men outside answered
she didn’t hear, for the noise below on the wharf had
been growing louder. Surely there was a riot going on!
“Oh, what is it?” she asked. “What’s the matter down
there?”</p>

<p>“The matter is it’s close on ten o’clock,” said the
man with the spectacles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>“But they promised to let the people in at nine!”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t they?”</p>

<p>“That’s why.” The spectacled face nodded toward
the smoking-room window. The voices in there were
held down now, but three of the faces were angrier than
ever. The fourth was sullen and set.</p>

<p>“Won’t you tell me what is happening?”</p>

<p>“Only a little false swearing.”</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“The size of the passenger list. The <i>Los Angeles</i> is
chartered to carry three hundred. They’ve sold over
five hundred first-class tickets.”</p>

<p>“Is that the inspector in there?”</p>

<p>The spectacles moved up and down, making “Yes”
with flashes of light, and the lowered voice said: “He’s
refused to sign our clearance papers.”</p>

<p>“Then we won’t get off?”</p>

<p>“Oh, probably.” The reply rang so cynical, as the
spectacled stranger walked after his silent companion,
that Hildegarde stared the more earnestly through the
window at the drama going on within.</p>

<p>Did they “square” the inspector? She only knew the
party broke up and melted away, and a few minutes
after, a change came over the crowd below. A sudden
animation that exploded in yells. Was it triumph? Or
was it rage? Or was it pain? Yes, surely some one was
crying “Help,” and a woman shrieked, and now a sound
like a flood breaking all barriers and deluging the world.
The lights went up on a sudden all over the ship, and
down below the gates gave way. In an incredibly short
time the ship that had seemed so lonely—it was full.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
And the torrent of humanity that swept in looked so
wild-eyed and disheveled, angry, and possessed by evil
passion, that Hildegarde turned and fled down the companionway,
and hid herself in her cabin. Ah, yes, she
wasn’t much of a heroine. It had been the work of a
few seconds to turn the dim and silent ship into a howling,
flaring pandemonium, hundreds of angry voices
clamoring, complaining, threatening, shouting questions,
muttering hoarse abuse. “The company”—everybody
was blaming the company. Dozens of people tried to
force their way into the cabin for five, at the foot of
whose authorized list of occupants stood the name of
“Miss H. Mar,” and in one of whose berths that intrepid
adventurer was sitting in the midst of her possessions,
cross-legged like a Turk, staring, listening, wondering
what was going to happen when Governor David M.
Jones appeared. Was this he? No, only a huge young
woman, in a man’s hat and ulster, who growled and
muttered unintelligibly—a foreigner, who seemed to be
cursing in Dutch. But this other, breathing American
fire and biblical brimstone, this must be Mrs. Governor
Jones, holding up her skirt, half torn out of its gathers.
Would she wreak vengeance for that as well as for
graver misfortunes on the Turk in the upper berth? As
the night wore on the people sorted themselves. Hildegarde
came to distinguish between the interlopers and
the women who belonged in here; battered and breathless
and worn out, but held together by a common bond of
fearsome experience in getting on board, and agreed,
besides, in regarding none too benevolently the person
who sat up there in the farther top berth, staring with
wide eyes at the stories of what the others had suffered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
and herself saying never a word, till some one came to
the door to ask if Miss Mar was “there all right.” “<em>I</em>
don’t know,” said the nearest woman crossly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes,” said the Turk, tumbling out of the top
berth. “Is that you, Louis?” Now she knew how sure
she had been, and how hugely glad of his coming. But
there at the door only the fat purser, who seemed to have
gone mad. He stared vacantly at the young lady, pulled
off his cap, and polishing his shining crown with a large
handkerchief, muttered abstractedly: “Oh—a—<em>that’s</em>
all hunky-dory!” and hurried away. As soon as she recovered
her breath, Hildegarde caught up her hat and
went after him to explain and to inquire.</p>

<p>But he was swallowed in the crowd. She made a tour
of the deck. But no, one couldn’t stay long, and anyhow
Cheviot wasn’t there. Not even the Blumpittys
seemed to be there. Curlyhead was refusing to come and
be put to bed, refusing in terms incredibly sulphurous
for one of such tender years. It turned you sick to hear
such language from baby lips.</p>

<p>“Where you off to?” said one man to another just in
front of Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“Goin’ to report to the authorities.”</p>

<p>“Report what?”</p>

<p>“The rat hole they’re askin’ me to sleep in.”</p>

<p>“Plenty o’ time. We ain’t goin’ to get off till to-morrer,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em> Why, we’re a week late a’ready.”</p>

<p>“Some of us’ll be later’n that. The authorities are
goin’ to hold back a couple of hundred fur the next
ship.”</p>

<p>“Who says so? <em>I</em> ain’t goin’ to wait.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well”—he lowered his voice—“there’s inconvenient
questions about over-crowdin’.”</p>

<p>The raging malcontent of the moment before was
straightway tamed. You saw in his face that he would
do his share in hushing up the conditions under which
he was to make the voyage.</p>

<p>As Hildegarde sped along the last stretch of the deck
before going below, her astonished eyes fell upon the
giant. Then he hadn’t got off by the <i>Congress</i>! She
was about to ask him if he’d seen the Blumpittys, but
some one else was surprised to find the giant on board
the <i>Los Angeles</i>—a puffing, excited individual, with a
red beard, in the act of pushing past, stopped, stared,
and then clapped the giant on the back. “Gawd A’mighty!
Is that you!”</p>

<p>“No,” says the giant calmly. “I’m Ford O’Gorman.”</p>

<p>Again Hildegarde hurried down the companionway,
and very much as an agitated tabby seeks refuge in the
attic, she clambered into the top berth furthest from the
door.</p>

<p>And Cheviot had never come!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">When she waked the next morning it was to a
sensation of strange silence and gentle motion.
Why, they had got off, then, after all!</p>

<p>She was on her way to Nome.</p>

<p>She sat up and looked about at the wreck
of wardrobe and the prostrate bodies of women. One
made a noise like a half-suppressed moan. After a moment
the owner of the little sound of misery got up and
tried to put on a pink flannel jacket. For some reason
that simple operation appeared to be painful. She was
about to abandon it. Hildegarde, half-way down from
her berth, said, “I’ll help you.” But the other shrank
away. “No, no.” She leaned her forehead against the
upper berth.</p>

<p>“You aren’t sick already, are you?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s only—they nearly broke my arm in the
crush last night.”</p>

<p>“Oh-h!”</p>

<p>“I think it’s just strained, that’s all.”</p>

<p>As she turned round to sit on the edge of her berth,
there, hanging outside the nightgown’s split sleeve, was
the injured arm, bare to the shoulder, swollen, discolored.</p>

<p>“Oh! What have you been doing for it?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of going out to get some cold water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is the water here hot?” Hildegarde asked, bewildered.</p>

<p>The woman didn’t trouble to answer.</p>

<p>Hildegarde was investigating. “Why, there’s no
water at all!”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>After more looking about, “Have you discovered
where the bell is?”</p>

<p>The woman lifted sleepless eyes and gave her an odd
look. “I don’t expect bells on this ship.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t know.” Hildegarde put on her dressing-gown,
took the tin ewer and sallied forth. After a
variety of adventures she came back. The woman lifted
her face out of the pillow when she heard the sound of
water splashing into the tin basin. “Oh, they got it for
<em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“No, I got it for myself. Come and hold your arm
over, won’t you? I’ll bathe it.”</p>

<p>A little surprised—a little doubtful, the woman got
up, saying, “Thank you.” What a nice voice said it!
But this fine-skinned, delicate-faced traveler was disposed
to be reserved. Hildegarde could feel that for
some reason she was suspicious of such ready friendliness.</p>

<p>“It’s most dreadfully bruised. How did you do it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a man.”</p>

<p>“How in the world—?”</p>

<p>“Against the barrier. He was trying to get in front of
me. I told him he was breaking my arm, but he—”
She left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Hildegarde’s eyes followed the last trickle of cool
water over the vivid purple and yellow and green of the
swollen bruise. No doubt the hurt showed the ghastlier
for the natural whiteness of the skin. “Well, whoever
did it would be sorry, I think, if he saw your arm this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Sorry?” She moistened the end of a towel and
Hildegarde helped her to arrange a loose compress.</p>

<p>“Yes; sorry and ashamed.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know them as I do.”</p>

<p>“Know who?”</p>

<p>“Men.” Then, as Hildegarde made no instant rejoinder,
“<em>I</em> was alone,” the woman added, so pointedly
that Hildegarde hastened to say, “I’m alone, too.”</p>

<p>But the other seemed not to believe this, or, at least,
to take no account of it. “Last night wasn’t my first
battle,” she said; “I’ve been in the wars all my life,”
and with a weary superiority she went back to her berth.</p>

<p>Ah, she was one of those women with a standing grievance!
Hildegarde felt for her the cheerful forbearance
of the person who unconsciously takes his own immunity
from rancor as a tribute to his nice disposition or his
balanced judgment.</p>

<p>Up on deck a flood of sunshine, a dazzling sea, a green
shore not yet very far away, a distant background of
snowcapped mountains.</p>

<p>On board the <i>Los Angeles</i> few people yet afoot. There
was Curlyhead dashing about, responding to Hildegarde’s
good-morning with a cheerful oath. She took
hold of him. “Listen to me,” she said, “you are not to
say such horrible things.”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” and more of the same sort. She dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
the child with precipitation and walked to the ship’s side.
Those two men just there by the life-boat, had they heard
the dreadful words? She was hot at the thought. They
seemed to be talking about the boy now, that spectacled
man and his friend. The friend must have a cold or
something wrong with him, for even on this glorious
morning he kept his arctic cap pulled down over his
neck, and his overcoat “storm collar” turned up above
his ears. Instead of taking a constitutional before breakfast,
there he was lounging behind the life-boat. The
spectacled man got tired of so sluggish a companion. He
left the muffled-up figure and began to tramp about by
himself. Hildegarde passed him with “good-morning.”
There was her steamer-chair in the corner. She ought to
get it out and place it before the deck overflowed.</p>

<p>The spectacled man lent a hand.</p>

<p>“Well, we did get off,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes. When was it?”</p>

<p>“About half past four, they say.”</p>

<p>“Then this is Puget Sound?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Those are the Cascade Mountains on that side.
The Olympics on the other.”</p>

<p>Just then the giant came swinging down the breezy
deck.</p>

<p>“Oh, do you know,” Hildegarde asked him, “if Mr.
and Mrs. Blumpitty got on board all right?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the smiling Hercules, “they got on
board.” He waited a moment. When the spectacled
gentleman had taken himself off. “Got your seat?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Won’t this be a good place?”</p>

<p>“I mean for meals.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>“Must I see about that?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t want to eat scraps at the second table or
the third.”</p>

<p>“My ticket is first-class.”</p>

<p>“That’s got nothing to do with it. Shall I go and see
they keep you a place?”</p>

<p>“Oh, will you?”</p>

<p>When she went down to breakfast she was bidden to
a vacant seat on the giant’s left. The other belonged to
one of the two ex-governors on board. But this particular
excellency was not up yet. Beyond the place reserved
was a lean lathe of a man, with a voracious appetite.
Opposite, sat a big, shy individual, to whom
people spoke deferentially as “Senator Cochrane.”
Next him a slim, attractive-looking woman, with fair
hair, too young, you would have said, to be the mother
of the girl beside her; but this pretty little person in her
teens was Mrs. L’Estrange’s daughter, so said the giant.
What on earth could be taking people like that? The
giant didn’t know. Neither did the person next him, a
gentleman with a white “goatee,” who told the company
that, as for himself, though, like everybody else, he
expected to get a claim, he was taking sixty dozen chickens
to Nome, and was “dead sure to make a good thing
of it.” He longed to talk more about chickens, and was
obviously disturbed by his stout friend further down,
who would keep shouting remarks to the chicken-merchant
about thirty-eight horses he had on board, and
whose conveyance to Nome was costing the fat gentleman
$100 apiece; and he didn’t grudge it. Indeed, the
horses’ quarters were so superior to the fat gentleman’s
own, that he’d “been thinkin’.” There wus one o’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
them horses—a daisy lot they were—but there wus one
of ’em he’d taken a dislike to. Didn’t know why, quite
groundless—but the fat man was like that. His wife
said he was notional. Perhaps she was right. He never
contradicted a lady. But, anyways, he was goin’ to give
up his own first-class accommodation. In future he
would bunk with the horses. And the one he had a “pick
on,” the mare with one white stocking and a star on her
forehead, she should have berth 147. If you had a quite
groundless but deadly spite against any one, that was a
sure way to fix her, just put her in berth 147. “Anyways—ladies
first,” he wound up, handing to the pretty
mother of the young girl a vast dish, in which slabs of
fat bacon floated in an inch of grease.</p>

<p>Not only the horse-dealer and the giant were attentive
to the supposed wants of the three women who appeared
at breakfast. Two of the roughest-looking of the men
had stood aside on Hildegarde’s entrance to let her go
first, and there were those who warmly recommended the
cold bully-beef, and yet others who urged upon her the
excellence of the hot buckwheats. Could these be the
wild animals who had roared and ravened outside the
night before?</p>

<p>At Hildegarde’s end of the table sat a group of three
who seemed to have interests in common. “Mining
men,” the giant said. They talked of the difficulty in
getting all their machinery on board. They and the
giant had stayed up till the <i>Los Angeles</i> left the port of
Seattle, mounting guard over their “stuff.” They aired
their views about the ship. Plenty of white paint on her
(or had been before so much of it came off on the passengers)—but
the <i>Los Angeles</i> was a whited sepulchre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hasn’t she just been an army transport?” ventured
Hildegarde, with the average American’s unquestioning
respect for anything indorsed by the Government.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, pressed into the service during the Spanish-American
war. But the <i>Los Angeles</i> is nothing more
nor less than an antiquated Cunarder from ‘way back,’
known to our grandfathers in the sixties as the rolling
<i>Roumelia</i>. She got such a bad name even in those days
of primitive ocean travel, that she had to clear out of
the Atlantic. They rechristened her, brought her round
the Horn and turned her on to the Japan trade. Except
for taking those Johnnies to Manila, she hadn’t carried
passengers for thirty years until this company got hold
of her, crowded in ten berths where there’d been two
before, or none at all, and lied about the number of people
they’d sold tickets to.”</p>

<p>In the act of shoveling in Boston beans with his knife,
the lean individual next Hildegarde paused to remark:
“If a man had committed the worst crime in the calendar,
it’d be a brutal punishment to make him sleep in
the suffocatin’ black hole they’ve put me in.”</p>

<p>“Exactly—” began one of the three financiers, assuming
the lean one to be agreeing with him.</p>

<p>“But,” interrupted the bean-feaster, “when they says
t’ me they wusn’t no more room, I says, ‘Lookee here,
it’s worth anywheres from fifty to sixty thousand dollars
to me to be among the first to git there. You can put me
in <em>any</em>wheres,’ I says. ‘Y’ can do anything in hell,’ I
says, ‘except leave me behind.’ An’ b’ gosh they done
it.” He champed his beans with a look that betokened
renewed relish at having given the conversation an unexpected
turn. Accomplished as this person was, he, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
a plate full of Boston beans and a knife, could do nothing
as original with his food as the passenger on the other
side of the table next to the pretty girl. After one fascinated
stare in his direction, Hildegarde felt it wiser to
look away. It was not, however, that moment’s astonishing
vision that prevented her from eating her own breakfast.
The giant was charitably concerned. Try this,
and that. But Hildegarde disposed of a little of the
sticky gray porridge and condensed milk, a sip of the
muddy coffee, and then she played with the sour bread
while she listened to the conversation. Suddenly, whirling
round her pivoted chair, she returned with ardor to
the sunshine-flooded upper regions.</p>

<p>It looked as though every soul who wasn’t at the first
breakfast must be on deck. In this clear and searching
light Miss Mar’s traveling companions stood revealed—a
strange, an unexampled crew. Scraps of German, of
Swedish, of French, and of tongues to which she had no
key, floated past her ear. In this new world of the <i>Los
Angeles</i>, no color line discoverable, no alien labor law in
force. Her eye fell upon the cryptic faces of the Japanese,
and on familiar types of negro and mulatto, cheek
by jowl with lawyers, clergymen, and senators. There
were raw, red Irishmen, and overdone brown Hebrews.
The captain went by talking broad Scotch to the English
doctor, and the pig-tailed crew pulled at the cordage in
unison to an uncouth Chinese chant.</p>

<p>And never was such sunshine, never shores so green,
never before mountain ranges so ethereal, so softly
touched with snow or wreathed in cloud.</p>

<p>But the people—the people!</p>

<p>The girl wandered about, all eyes, or sat in her long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
chair, for which there was hardly room now on the
swarming deck. She held in one hand a little volume in
which never a page was turned, for here, moving up and
down before her, was matter more wonderful than any
history written in any book. The thought she found
coming up oftenest: What on earth takes him—or her—to
Nome? For Louis, it seems, was in one thing right.
Here was no Klondike company of sturdy pioneers, all
men of brawn, or Amazonian women. Some such were
in the throng, but the majority, weedy clerks and dyspeptic
nondescripts. There went a man with only one
arm to dig his gold. Several smartly dressed ladies
flashed by with an air of being on their way to a garden
party. Here was a hollow-chested youth with a corpse-like
face, crawling painfully about with the aid of a cane.
There were other children besides Curlyhead, and a number
of quite old men—one grizzled creature with both
feet “club.” What are <em>they</em> going to do in such a place
as Nome? Hildegarde seemed to be the only one to wonder.
Every face shining, every heart seemed lifted up.
One and all were well-assured they had only to see Nome
to “obtain joy and gladness.” “Nome is the place,”
their faces said, “where sorrow and sighing shall flee
away.”</p>

<p>Here were the Blumpittys, looking a good deal battered,
but he, at least, no gloomier than common, and she
beaming like all the rest. Hildegarde got up to greet
them. “I looked for you at breakfast.”</p>

<p>“We are having ours later,” quoth Mrs. Blumpitty,
as one admitting habits luxurious. But since the second
table had been summoned some time before it was patent
that to be of the Blumpitty party meant you must eat at
the third.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you comfortable where you are?” inquired the
rusty one solicitously.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, quite, thank you,” said Hildegarde, a little
ashamed at being so infinitely better off than poor Mrs.
Blumpitty. But that lady, with an air of subdued pride,
was presenting, “One of our party, Dr. Daly,” an important-looking
man of thirty or so, with a highly impressive
manner. “Ruth, Ruth, please come here! My
niece, Miss Sears.” “My niece” was little and shy and
brown. Hildegarde felt instantly that she was a nice
niece. “And this is Mr. Tobin. Dr. Merton”—about
nineteen this last gentleman, with the complexion of a
lucky girl. “And Dr. Thomas.” Why, it rained doctors!
Which was the dentist? Hildegarde on reflection
decided they were all dentists. “Oh, and here comes
Miss Leroy Schermerhorn!” Mrs. Blumpitty spoke in
the tone of a chamberlain announcing “Her Majesty the
Queen!” Through the crowd advanced the heralded
“business woman to Blumpitty &amp; Co.,” a lady of twenty-eight
or thirty, with a somewhat defiant face under the
shadow of a fuzzy black bang, and a ruthless eye. When
it had pierced Miss Mar in many a vital spot, it fell upon
the only deck-chair on the ship, with its “robe” and
scarlet cushion. “Well, you’re making yourself pretty
comfortable,” said Miss Leroy Schermerhorn. “Like
your room?”</p>

<p>Hildegarde was in no haste to reply.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blumpitty bridged the chasm. “I was so glad
when I heard you’d got a berth up-stairs.”</p>

<p>“I guess it cost you a lot,” said Miss Schermerhorn,
with a snap of her eyes.</p>

<p>“No,” said Hildegarde. “It was a piece of luck.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m that glad and relieved,” said Mrs. Blumpitty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
as the haughty Schermerhorn retired a few paces
to whisper conclusions in Dr. Thomas’ ear, while surreptitiously
both pursued their study of Miss Mar. But
Mrs. Blumpitty’s eye still angled among the sea creatures
that swarmed upon the waters of Puget Sound.
With a little jerk of satisfaction she landed yet another
big fish.</p>

<p>“Miss Estelle Maris.”</p>

<p>Oh, yes, the lady with the languid air, the rakish hat
and red velveteen blouse; this was the one who “said”
she could cook.</p>

<p>“Any more of our party up yet?” Mrs. Blumpitty
asked her.</p>

<p>“Guess the rest’s asleep,” answered Miss Estelle
Maris.</p>

<p>“Guess so, too,” said Mr. Blumpitty, with benevolence.
“We wus all pretty tired.” And that was the
sole reference to the battle of the night before. Neither
then nor later from any member of Blumpitty’s staunch
party a syllable of complaint at their quarters on the ship.</p>

<p>Mr. Blumpitty himself, during these amenities and
some further conversation, had stood by the ship’s side,
looking sadly toward Vancouver Island.</p>

<p>“There goes our breakfast horn,” said his wife at last,
as one who offers substantial cheer.</p>

<p>The Blumpitty party melted away; only the leader
remained. “Guess everybody that ain’t on deck’s either
eatin’ or asleep.” He offered it as a general comment
upon existence.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said Miss Mar.</p>

<p>“And the smokin’-room’ll be empty. Will you step
in there a minute?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes.” (What on earth—?)</p>

<p>“Little matter o’ business,” he said, leading the way.</p>

<p>Two men in one corner puffed bad cigars while they
bent over a glazed paper, whereon a certain property
was outlined in red ink. No one else there. Hildegarde
and Mr. Blumpitty took the opposite corner.</p>

<p>“I got t’ give y’ $25,” said Blumpitty, as one who
has studied every alternative.</p>

<p>“What in the world for?” asked the young lady.</p>

<p>“Bonus on the <i>Congress</i> ticket.” He had pulled a
roll of bills out of his pocket, and the breeze in the
transit from open porthole to open door paused on its
way to toy with greenbacks of a goodly denomination.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know there was a bonus,” said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“Naw,” said Blumpitty vaguely, as he handed her the
money. He got up murmuring “breakfast.” But when
he found himself on his feet he glanced with slow caution
at the absorbed faces opposite, still bent over the map
of a mining district, and lowering his voice, “Did Mrs.
Mar say anything to you touchin’ the Mother Lode?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t mention it, will yer?”</p>

<p>As Hildegarde looked up to say, “Oh, no, indeed,”
there was the spectacled man’s friend at the porthole.
At least it looked like his cap and his high collar, for
that was all of him that any one could see. Even that
much vanished the moment Hildegarde raised her eyes.
When she and Mr. Blumpitty reached the deck the
arctic cap was nowhere to be seen. How had he disappeared
so quickly in such a crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. Blumpitty paused a moment before going below,
muttering to himself, “I jest been talkin’ to a gentleman”—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
yellow-gray eyes went over the heads of the
throng—“a gentleman that thinks <em>he</em> knows where it
is.”</p>

<p>“The Mother Lode?”</p>

<p>Blumpitty’s pale visage relaxed to something remotely
like a smile as he answered, “But he don’t.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Hildegarde, “all these people in one
way or another hope to find it—the Mother Lode, you
know.”</p>

<p>Blumpitty’s vague eyes came back from the snowcapped
range of the Cascades, and dwelt with a ruminant
sympathy upon the passing faces. “Ya-as, they
think they’re headin’ straight fur it. But they ain’t.”</p>

<p>“Nobody on all this ship, or on all the other ships is
really heading straight but you.”</p>

<p>“Wa-al”—he seemed to wish to be strictly, punctiliously
accurate—“I got to go to Snow Gulch first.”</p>

<p>“But after that?”</p>

<p>“Ya-as. After that!” And Blumpitty went to the
third breakfast-table on his way to millionairedom and
the Mother Lode.</p>

<p>The girl lay back in her long chair and stared at the
crowd, thinking how strange it was that Hildegarde Mar
should be among them, and even while she wondered the
sense of strangeness was wearing away.</p>

<p>And these purblind, trustful creatures, filled with
their pathetic hopes, was it of them she had been afraid?
She smiled at the absurdity. They were rough and
crude, but not in the least alarming—except at a distance.
She pondered this, catching glimpses of a truth
of wider application. When the motley throng had stood
without the gate struggling and crying to be allowed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
board this enchanted ship, when Hildegarde had stood
apart from them, not enlightened by sharing in their lot,
she had had her moments of misgiving, or rather she had
been seized by a quite childish panic.</p>

<p>And, after all, what harm can they do me? Poor
little Curlyhead, they might teach him a few more bad
words (though even that was open to doubt)—one or two
ignorant girls in their teens, they might suffer. But
Hildegarde Mar—how could they hurt a person twenty-six
years old, who is among them for a few days out of
a lifetime. What’s the good of me and my better advantages
if I can be injured by this sort of thing?</p>

<p>It was something to get back her courage to be alone
among these people. Last night she had been under an
illusion about them. Yes, she had had some bad moments,
but they had come chiefly because she had so
set her heart on seeing—yet no, let her be honest.
Louis’s neglect had put her out of tune, disheartened her
quite unaccountably, but the worser moments had come
through positive fear. And the fear had come—oh, it
was clear now—it had come through having her mind
filled with foreboding by the people who cared most for
her. There was always that potency in evil prophecy—it
went a long way toward bringing about its own fulfilment.
If good were foretold you were afraid to believe
it. If evil you were afraid not to believe.</p>

<p>There was that much truth in the fabled power of the
Evil Eye. Her expedition had been so frowned on, eyed
so askance; small wonder she had failed to keep her
courage quite untarnished. Well, she had found out one
thing on the threshold of the journey. It is the fear felt
for us by the men who love us that makes cowards of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
womankind; it is others’ shrinking that goes far to make
us quail.</p>

<p>She took a sheet of folded note-paper out of her little
Tennyson and her pencil traced the words: “On board
the <i>Los Angeles</i>, May 31, 1900. My dear Louis—” Yes,
she would write him a long, long letter, and tell him how
little ground there was for fear. But she would write
very gently, even humbly, and get him to understand
and to forgive her. She would show him how much
better his fellow-men were than he had given out.</p>

<p>She remembered with an instant’s loss of enthusiasm
her room-mate’s account of the matter. But she decided
that lady was of a carping and a gloomy nature—she
looked on the dark side. Perhaps Hildegarde would
feel less cheerful herself if she’d had her arm nearly
broken—but an accident could happen anywhere.</p>

<p>“And the stoop-shouldered man is the father.” It
was Mrs. Locke, Hildegarde’s room-mate, who said the
words, her eyes on Curlyhead. That person, in a towering
rage, stood in a group of laughing men. They were
plaguing him just to hear him swear. Mrs. Locke was
still very white, her arm in a sling. But what a nice
face she had!</p>

<p>“<em>Do</em> sit here,” Hildegarde urged, and finally prevailed.
The new-comer said very little. Others stopped in passing
and talked to Hildegarde. Mrs. Locke sat and looked
at the sea. Before one o’clock a stiff breeze sprang up.
It cleared the deck as if the people had been so many
mosquitoes, for the <i>Los Angeles</i> began to roll. “I am a
fair sailor,” said Mrs. Locke. “I shan’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is where you are!” some one was saying
familiarly just behind them, Hildegarde thought to Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
Locke. But on looking round she met the purser’s fascinating
smile. Mrs. Locke got up instantly, murmuring
something about feeling the need of a walk. The purser
dropped comfortably into the vacant chair.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, and how do you find yourself this
morning?” As Miss Mar did not instantly respond,
“Goin’ to be a good sailor?” he said, with a great display
of teeth.</p>

<p>Hildegarde looked at him and decided he was a little
idiotic, but that she must have dreamed the “dear.” She
answered him upon that supposition. Still he talked
rather queerly, she thought, till the first horn sounded
for dinner.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a place for you at my table,” he said, getting
up.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, but I have a seat already.”</p>

<p>“That don’t matter, it won’t go beggin’. I’m lookin’
out for you all right,” he assured her, as though he had
heard himself accused of neglect. “I was up till five
this mornin’, so I slept late, or I’d been around before.”</p>

<p>“It is very good of you, but I’ve got quite a good
place. I won’t change, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, don’t be huffy. How could I tell
you’d be up at breakfast? Come along, my dear.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde stared at him, and then she said quite
gently: “I’m not the least huffy, but I’ll keep the seat
I have, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well! <em>Very well!</em>” and he took himself off
in a state that might, perhaps, be described in his own
words as “huffy”—oh, but very huffy indeed.</p>

<p>Before Vancouver’s Island faded out of sight everybody
was greatly intrigued to see the men of the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
post there signaling the passing ship. What were they
doing that for? People ran about the decks asking one
another, “What’s happened?” It was an exciting moment,
for this communication, whatever it was, would be
the last the <i>Los Angeles’</i> passengers would know for
many a day of the great world’s happenings. A boom
of cannon came across the water. The news filtered
down from the bridge: “Lord Roberts has entered Pretoria!”</p>

<p>“And that’s the last human sign,” said ex-Governor
Reinhart, “till we sight the ships at Nome.”</p>

<p>“Or, better still,” amended one of the first table
financiers, “the last till we signal to the Nomites: The
fleet’s behind! We’ve won the race. ’Rah! for the
<i>Los Angeles</i>!” The betting had already begun. The
run was to be anything from a week to a month.</p>

<p class="tb">Losing sight of land meant losing sunshine and calm
seas, almost, it would appear, losing the vast majority of
the passengers.</p>

<p>The next few days saw a surprisingly deserted deck.
The <i>Los Angeles</i>, however antiquated, had lost none of
her pristine capacity for rolling. At least ninety per
cent. of the people were laid low. Most of the stewards
(all green hands working their passage to Nome), instead
of ministering to others on the way, were making
the voyage on their backs.</p>

<p>Hildegarde, the only one of her cabin to leave it,
dragged herself on deck early every morning to find
fortitude by dint of staying out in the air. It was not
solely the awful pitching of the ship, not even the added
discomfort of the dank, cold weather, that made up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
sum of her discomfort. The purser had got on her
nerves. Still she didn’t like snubbing him any more
than was strictly necessary—not from fear of reprisals
(though, beyond a doubt, he was a power in this tiny
kingdom), but because it was hideous to her even to see
any one’s self-respect hurt, let alone be the one to deal
the wound. Nor could she help sympathizing with him.
He must be under a ludicrous and rather pathetic illusion
about himself to “go on” like this. Whenever he
could be spared from his duties, there, wherever Miss
Mar turned, was the fat purser, practising his most killing
smiles, and proffering aid and companionship. In
these gray and dripping days of nearly abandoned
decks, her sole refuge was in the society of the giant,
who discoursed pleasantly of sea-birds, and in any moment’s
lifting of the fog pointed out more whales. And
he piloted Hildegarde’s see-sawing steps fore and aft till
she found her sea-legs. She was vaguely conscious that
at a pinch she might count on the spectacled man.</p>

<p>Three days, now since she had had a sign from the
Blumpittys or any of their party except Dr. Daly. He
had laughed and said: “They’re all very busy. Guess
they don’t want to be disturbed.”</p>

<p>It was a relief when in the middle of a rainy afternoon
Ruth Sears came to the surface. She was very wan and
looked pathetic, childish, and attractive, too, in a skirt
to her knees, stout boots and long gaiters. And she had
come to ask Miss Mar for a little meat extract for Mrs.
Blumpitty.</p>

<p>Hildegarde had not waited for that moment to be glad
she had disregarded the warm recommendation not to
bother with ship supplies of her own, but to help herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
out of the Blumpittys’ and pay at the end of the
voyage.</p>

<p>Ruth said sadly: “There’s been some mistake. Our
grocery box can’t be found.” Down the two girls and
the giant went to the regions behind the dining-saloon
to open the provision-box whose contents had been Miss
Mar’s daily solace. There, in the swaying dingy murk,
where the figures of Chinamen flitted, they opened the
padlocked box and drew forth jars of Liebig, crackers,
cheese, and silver packets of tea.</p>

<p>“Oh, it <em>is</em> kind of you!” Ruth’s gentle eyes were shining.
“She hasn’t had anything for forty-eight hours,
but she’ll be able to eat <em>now</em>.”</p>

<p><em>Poor</em> Mis’ Bumble Bee!</p>

<p>“I’ll lend you my alcohol lamp,” said Hildegarde.
“I make tea every afternoon when it isn’t too rough.
Won’t you come and have some?”</p>

<p>The wan little niece going off with her hands full,
paused an instant. “If—if I’m able, thank you.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be more on deck. Of course you’re
ill if you stay down there.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t take care of them if I didn’t,” and she
was gone.</p>

<p>The next day the fat purser was so all-pervading that
Hildegarde felt herself making up her mind that really
something must be done. She had scant patience with
girls who complained at this order of infliction. Her firm
conviction, “It’s their own fault”; though just how the
purser’s foolishness was hers she could not determine.</p>

<p>The afternoon was wild and rough, the smoking-room,
packed and noisy. The overflow of men, with a few
very subdued-looking women, sat below in the “Ladies’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Saloon”—a feebly-lit, ill-smelling little room, where an
aged upright piano kept company with a hurly-burly of
freight and three rickety chairs. Hildegarde’s fortitude
threatened to give way after two minutes of the foul,
close air. But up on deck the purser! and not a soul
beside, except the bean-feaster, Mr. Isaiah Joslin, trudging
up and down in oilskins, and the arctic cap driven
off the bridge by the inclement weather. He sat in the
most sheltered corner of the upper deck, obviously
asleep, with arms folded and head withdrawn into his
collar. The wind rose and the rain swept down upon
the place where Hildegarde and the giant (with intervals
of purser) had spent the morning. Oh, where was
that giant now? She moved her chair to the better
shelter near the arctic cap. At least, the purser did it
for her, and was altogether so oppressive with his poor
little gallantries and what the giant called his “toothsome
smile,” that Hildegarde felt, whatever the penalty
of his worst displeasure, in another moment she would
be doing something more drastic than throwing out
broad hints which he either disregarded or affected to
consider humorous. She wished now that before moving
she had said something even he couldn’t misunderstand.
With another man by it would make the purser mad
with fury. In any case, hardly fair to subject him
publicly to a snubbing as effectual as she saw was going
to be necessary. The arctic cap, for all the seeming
blindness and deafness of his hidden face, might be
listening. So Miss Mar merely drew her tartan plaid
up about her shoulders and observed with some gravity
that she was going to sleep. The purser took up a romantic
attitude at her feet, saying, “Good-night.” Hildegarde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
jumped up. “I’ll go and see how Mrs. Blumpitty
is.”</p>

<p>Getting rid of the purser lent a rapture even to going
below. And as she went she smiled, remembering how
her mother was comforting herself with the thought of
the Blumpittys (“splendid sailors” both of them!)
pledged to watch over Miss Mar, and if she were laid
low to bring her sustenance on deck out of their private
supplies. Four days and no glimpse of either of her
guardian angels till this moment, when, rolling through
the second saloon on her way to smooth Mrs. Blumpitty’s
pillow, Hildegarde, pitching from side to side, clutching
at anything within reach to steady herself, caught
sight of her stand-by, her protector, the man who was
going to minister to her and “see her through,” Blumpitty,
with ghastly visage, clinging to the knob of a
cabin door like a shipwrecked mariner to a spar. In
these days of seclusion poor Mr. Blumpitty had sadly
altered, wearing now a yellow-gray beard of some five
days’ growth, bristling upon a countenance pea-green
and pitiful.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that you?” says the young lady, holding on to
the rough board that covered with newspapers at meal
time, did duty down here for a dining-table. “How do
you do?”</p>

<p>“How—” Blumpitty stopped at that and devoted
his entire attention to keeping hold of the knob.</p>

<p>Hildegarde didn’t quite like to go away and leave
him to his fate, at a moment so abject in the Blumpitty
history, nor did she quite know how to conduct a conversation
under these conditions. She decided frankness
was best. So, as her friend still clutched and tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
to steady himself, she gave way a little to smiling. “I
thought you were a seasoned old salt, Mr. Blumpitty.”</p>

<p>He only rolled his yellow eyes—but no, that statement
is misleading, for Blumpitty rolled his entire economy.
Yet never a word rolled out. Hildegarde, wishing to
spare his feelings, added, as she turned to go, “A great
many people seem to have been bowled over by the
pitching of <em>this</em> ship.”</p>

<p>“No ship,” said Blumpitty in a sepulchral whisper,
“no <em>ship</em> could make a man feel like this.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde was alarmed. Was Mr. Blumpitty about
to be snatched from them by some fell disease?</p>

<p>“Wh-what do you think it is?” she inquired, with another
lurch, but much sympathy.</p>

<p>He clung now with both hands to his savior-knob,
while the rolling <i>Roumelia</i> worked her own wild will
upon Mr. Blumpitty’s contorted frame. “It’s the
cook,” he groaned.</p>

<p>“The <em>cook</em>!” This was indeed terrible! His brain
was giving way!</p>

<p>“Yes,” he went on hoarsely in an interval of comparative
steadiness, “I know these fellows. If a sea-cook
thinks he’s got too many people to feed—he—oh,
Gawd!—he puts stuff in the coffee, or soap in the bread—and—people
don’t want to eat any more.”</p>

<p><i>Roumelia</i> resented this aspersion upon her son. She
shot Mr. Blumpitty forward with extreme violence, and
he, entirely without volition, found himself going on
deck. But perhaps the same force that took him up
brought him down and put him to bed, for Hildegarde
saw him no more.</p>

<p>Over her further descent into that part of the ship she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
had been intended to occupy, it is considerate to draw a
veil.</p>

<p>She reappeared like a mourner at a funeral, following
at Ruth’s side in the wake of a figure borne on a
mattress between a steward and the giant. The prostrate
form of poor Mis’ Bumble Bee, speechless, blind,
deaf, was laid in the one sheltered corner of the deck.
Ruth, very weak and unsteady, went back to that fetid
under-world that beggared description, ministering to
miserable men and women lying helpless on shelves, tier
above tier to the ceiling. Even to be down there for five
minutes was a thing to be remembered shuddering as
long as one lived.</p>

<p>After putting her cushion under Mrs. Blumpitty’s
head, Hildegarde glanced round.</p>

<p>“Lookin’ fur the purser?” said Mr. Isaiah Joslin,
grinning and holding on to a stanchion.</p>

<p>“No,” said Hildegarde, with some dignity.</p>

<p>Mr. Joslin accepted a graver view of life’s possibilities.
“That feller’ll get a thrashin’ if he don’t look out.”</p>

<p>“The purser?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Why—who will—?”</p>

<p>“That man up there’ll be attendin’ to it.” Mr. Joslin
nodded toward the bridge. The Arctic Cap was
scanning the misty world through Captain Gillies’
glass.</p>

<p>“Why should he? Besides, I thought he was an
invalid.”</p>

<p>“Wa-al, maybe that’s it. P’raps he thinks it’d be
good fur his health.”</p>

<p>“What would?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>“W’y wallopin’ the purser.”</p>

<p>“What’s <em>he</em> got against the purser?”</p>

<p>“<em>Says</em> he don’t like the color of his hair. But as the
purser ain’t got no hair, it’s my private opinion the
gentleman up there don’t like his fascinatin’ ways.” He
looked significantly at the tall girl. Hildegarde bent
down to tuck the tartan round Mrs. Blumpitty. Now,
why on earth should the Arctic Cap care how the purser
behaved to—other people?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">When Mrs. Blumpitty found herself being
taken below that first evening, she revived
sufficiently to protest, and so frustrated the
giant’s amiable design of carrying her off
to bed. The invalid stayed on deck day and
night, and instead of dying as the captain and all the
passengers confidently expected, she got well and “lived
happy ever after” on that voyage upon Miss Mar’s supplies,
sharing even the fresh eggs which the giant, by
some means, acquired daily from the Nome-bound hens.
Hildegarde was sorry she lacked courage to share Mrs.
Blumpitty’s new quarters. But the “queerness” of
sleeping out of your bed—in the public eye, too!—almost
the immodesty of it (in the passenger mind), if unpalliated,
as in Mrs. Blumpitty’s case, by threatened dissolution—no,
it was too daunting. Since Mrs. Locke
could “stand it” in the cabin, Hildegarde must. Even
Mrs. Locke’s seamanship had gone down before the <i>Roumelia’s</i>
roll, but she was getting better. She made fitful
appearances on deck. But there was something odd
about her. You never knew whether it was sea-sickness
or distrust of her kind that would carry her suddenly
below when a fellow-passenger stopped to speak to her.</p>

<p>Fresh from a raid upon the provision-box, Hildegarde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
coming on deck one evening, found Mrs. Locke in an
hour of clearing weather between showers. There was
even a strip of ruddy sunset to gladden the voyager’s
heart.</p>

<p>Hildegarde looked round for her chair.</p>

<p>“It rained two drops a little while ago,” observed
Mrs. Locke, “and the man you call the giant moved your
things.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did he?” Hildegarde stood at the ship’s side,
looking at the fading red.</p>

<p>By and by, “Sit on half my stool,” suggested Mrs.
Locke.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Hildegarde, feeling that coming
from such a source this invitation was immensely cordial.
“It’s very kind of you.”</p>

<p>“No, that isn’t it.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“You’re the sort of person everybody wants to do
things for.” She seemed to point it out as a fault on
Miss Mar’s part.</p>

<p>Hildegarde looked at her curiously. “I should have
thought <em>you</em> were more that kind of person, except
for—” The cameo-like face must have been beautiful
before it grew so white and set. You felt that a touch
of color even now, a little happiness, would make it irresistible.</p>

<p>“Except?” Mrs. Locke echoed.</p>

<p>“Well, you know you <em>do</em>—Shall I say it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You do receive friendliness a good deal at the point
of the sword.”</p>

<p>“I’ve learnt my lesson.” As Hildegarde said nothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
“Wait till <em>you</em> are—” But any inclination to be
more explicit vanished.</p>

<p>Hildegarde thought she had intended to say, “Wait
till you’re as old as I.” “I have a feeling you
know immensely more than I do,” said the girl, “but I
don’t believe you’re much older.”</p>

<p>“I’m thirty-two.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m twenty-six.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look that much.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s having eyes so wide apart.”</p>

<p>“No, I think it’s your childish chin and your air of
believing everything. But, anyhow, my thirty-two
counts double.” Then, as if again to turn the conversation
away from herself, “You’re an infant, but rather a
wise infant, after all,” she added, relenting a little.
“Only what takes you to Nome?”</p>

<p>Hildegarde told her. “And what are you going for?”</p>

<p>“Money.”</p>

<p>“Not beach gold,” said the girl smiling.</p>

<p>“I’ve been sent for. I shall be bookkeeper to one of
the large companies.”</p>

<p>“Oh-h.” Hildegarde’s big eyes were so obviously uncongratulatory
that Mrs. Locke said firmly, “It’s work
I’m used to.”</p>

<p>“But—up there, won’t it be very rough and difficult
for—for any one like you—all alone?”</p>

<p>“They pay three times what I’ve been getting. I’m
very lucky to have the offer, at least as I count luck now.
I used to think—to have ambitions.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder,” said Hildegarde, betraying a flattering
confidence in the other’s powers.</p>

<p>“I know my measure now. I’m a failure.” And still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
there was no weakness, no repining in her tone. Level
and courageous, but without comfort, wholly without
anticipation.</p>

<p>“What shall you do with the money you make?”</p>

<p>“Buy freedom.” Was she thinking of divorce? Apparently
not, for she went on, “No woman’s free who
hasn’t enough to live on without asking anybody for it.
So I’m going to Nome to avoid slavery.”</p>

<p>“Your husband doesn’t mind?”</p>

<p>“He’s dead.” No trace of emotion in the low voice.
But yielding to the invitation in the girl’s eyes, she told
in brief outline of a hard life. The last six years of it
alone. “But as to that, I was alone before. Only people
didn’t know it, and so things were easier.”</p>

<p>“How easier?”</p>

<p>“There are always people to help the women who
don’t need help”—and then something of the disillusion
that followed upon her husband’s death; of difficult
bread-winning; of inforced close relations with men
through her work, and what she thought of them. “Exceptions?
Well, I suppose so. I’ve once or twice
thought the exception had come my way.”</p>

<p>“And were you wrong—<em>always</em> wrong?”</p>

<p>“You see the kind of men a bookkeeper in a western
town is thrown with—oh, you have to walk very warily,
to hold yourself down, to seem to misunderstand—not to
let your disgust cost you your bread and butter.” Hildegarde
looked at the pure outline of the profile again.
It was all very well to talk of having learnt lessons and
of being over thirty, thought the girl. Mrs. Locke’s
troubles aren’t over yet.</p>

<p>But perhaps she would find something better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
money on this journey, a real friend, or even—Several
of the passengers were disposed to be conspicuously civil.
There was that lawyer with the clever face. He was
walking the deck now in the giant’s company, and every
time he passed he looked at Mrs. Locke.</p>

<p>“I’m sure that man wants to come and talk to you,”
said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“If you get up, I shall go below.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you like Mr. Meyer?”</p>

<p>“Why should I like Mr. Meyer?”</p>

<p>“Well, he likes you. Doesn’t that a little—just a
little—No? Well, then, there’s another reason. He
told me he thought you were so plucky that you ought to
be helped.” As even this generous sentiment seemed
not to melt the lady, “You’d better be nice to him,”
said Hildegarde lightly, smiling in her effort to make
her companion a little cheerfuller. “He told me he
could get you a Nome lot that you could sell by and by
for $2000.”</p>

<p>“Did he say what I was to pay for it?”</p>

<p>“You don’t pay anything, that’s what’s so beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Really! Why doesn’t he get it for himself?”</p>

<p>“He’ll have one, too. Everybody will who knows—as
he does—which are the forfeited ones. The thing is, you
must live on the lot. Then you acquire squatter’s sovereignty,
and you can sell it for $2000.”</p>

<p>“I see; and how much am I to give Mr. Meyer?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you <em>are</em> suspicious! He takes a real interest.
He wants to ‘put you on to’ some unrecorded mining
property he knows about.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Has he told you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>“He didn’t tell me why a busy man like Meyer should
stop to think of me.”</p>

<p>“Do you think men never help women?”</p>

<p>“Yes, when they see some advantage for themselves.”
And then dark histories. The general effect of her experience,
the sum total of that knowledge she had
brought out of commerce with men, and which was always
ready to rise up and menace her—it seemed almost
incredible to the sheltered woman. But it was not all
narrow, personal repining. Mrs. Locke had theories.
She had lived once in a state where women voted. She
told stories of going to the polls. In spite of the opposition
of male politicians she had once herself held office.</p>

<p>“Well, how did you like being a notary public?”</p>

<p>“I hated it, but it taught me things.”</p>

<p>“Unless my life’s a failure,” she said, with an unconscious
loftiness, “I don’t expect to have time to
bother about politics.”</p>

<p>“You’d feel differently if you didn’t belong to the
privileged class.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I don’t. I belong to quite plain people. And
we’ve been very poor.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever worked for your living?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Intelligent and able-bodied, and yet
you’ve—”</p>

<p>“I’ve helped at home.”</p>

<p>“You may have saved the wages of a housekeeper or
a sewing woman, but you’ve taken what was given you
as a dole; and you haven’t a notion what you’d do if
the men of your family died or cast you off. Or—<em>have</em>
you?”</p>

<p>“I never thought about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s what I mean. You belong to what they call
the privileged class. The ‘privilege’ is to know as little
of life as a pet canary.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde only laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you sing very sweetly, and the song says
you’ve got all the rights you want. All it means is that
through some man living or dead the singer has what
material comforts she needs. And the burden of the
song is, ‘Look how contented and feminine I am. <em>I’m</em>
all right. With the mass of womankind it’s different,
but I shan’t bother.’”</p>

<p>“You think it’s different with the mass?”</p>

<p>“You know it is. Never mind”—she made a little
impatient move of the head as though to free her brain
from some thorny contact—“I’ve had my time of trying
to help the rest. From this on I have just one object.
I’ve made up my mind to put up with any and
everything till I’ve bought my freedom. That’s why
I’m here.”</p>

<p>“How long will it take you to buy freedom?” asked
Hildegarde.</p>

<p>Mrs. Locke clasped one hand over the other on the
railing of the ship and leaned her chin down on the
whitened knuckles. She fixed her steady eyes upon the
wave-fretted, glaucous-looking waste, less like water than
like vast fields of molten lead, falling into furrows, forever
shifting and forever shaped anew. “I say to myself
that if I slave and rough it for five years more, I
shall be able to buy a little home in the country and know
some peace before I die.”</p>

<p>It seemed a gray existence, and Hildegarde, with the
hopeful self-sufficiency of happy youth, felt in her heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
that the woman must somehow be to blame. Men were
not always or usually what Mrs. Locke gave out. Even
in the crush at the wharf, though the rougher people
had pushed and jostled and sworn, nobody had tried to
break Hildegarde’s arm. Mrs. Blumpitty had roughed
it, but she didn’t complain of men, though Blumpitty
must be a trial. No, poor Mis’ Bumble Bee, on her pallet
of straw in the corner of the deck, was by the side of this
other woman an enviable object even in the worst weather,
and the statement may stand although it lack its
true significance to that portion of mankind which happened
not to be in the North Pacific or the Bering Sea in
the first June of this century. Even when the weather
was not doing anything spectacular, the dank chill was
of the sort that searched the marrow. The fogs penetrated
tweed and mackinaw and even leather, till people’s
apparel wilted, and conducing less to warmth than
shivering, clung to their figures as clammily as a half-dried
bathing dress. The rugs and “robes” and wraps
weighed each a ton—the very bedclothes seemed never to
be dry. Day and night the fog-horn hooted, or, when
the all-enveloping grayness lifted for a little, it was only
to loosen the great rains, as if most mighty Jupiter
Pluvius, thinking to use the ship for his tub, had pulled
the shower-bath string just above it, discharging a waterspout
over the <i>Los Angeles</i>. And after that, sleet, mist
drizzle, and fog again.</p>

<p>Every man on board began to suffer visibly and audibly
from the national complaint. In vain they hawked
and spat and trumpeted; the great American Cold had
them by the nose. All they could do in their misery was
to reduce companionway and deck to a condition best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
left undescribed. But it was this more than any other
thing that made the heart of the unhappy Hildegarde to
falter and grow faint.</p>

<p>There were moments when, too chilled to sit still, worn
out with tramping up and down, wet, and yet more miserable
by reason of certain sights and sounds, she, nevertheless,
rather than face the greater horror below, would
stay on deck all day, wondering a little sometimes that
she could suffer so much acute physical misery and yet
not rue her coming. For even now, the moment she envisaged
a possible escape—a passing yacht that should
take her luxuriously home, or any pleasant miracle of
rescue—she discovered that come what would, she was
not only bound to keep on, but as determined to see it
through as she had been that night of Louis’s return,
when, innocent of most that it implied, she had said she
would go and bring her father home.</p>

<p>In the carrying out of her resolution there was nothing,
as yet, to be afraid of in the sense she vaguely had
supposed her brothers and Louis Cheviot to mean, but of
sheer physical wretchedness and soul-sickness, enough
and to spare for the chastening of any spirit.</p>

<p>There had been a good deal of heavy drinking in the
last day or two. As for Curlyhead’s father, he seemed
never to be sober, and yet he had wits enough left, as well
as cash, to bear a hand in endless games of poker. At
first there had been little card-playing. But now, as
people began to grow used to the motion, they crawled
out of their berths to look at the world from the upper-deck,
shiver and go below. Down there, what was there
to do but the one thing? If you played once, you played
every day, and all day, and more than half the night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
People who couldn’t as yet sit at the table to eat, sat
there between meals breakfasting, dining, supping off
“chips” and bits of pasteboard—not missing fleshpots,
since always a jackpot graced the board. There were
those who grudged the meal hours. Glowering upon the
people who used the tables for mere eating, they stood
about impatient till a place was cleared and the real
business of poker might begin.</p>

<p>The same thing went on straight through the ship.
According to the giant, they were as hard at it in the
second-class as they were in the first, and on down as far
as the horrible berths went, wherever men could get a
board or a barrel-head, there they were with cards in
their hands.</p>

<p>Not men only. And not only the woman with the
sealskin jacket and the diamond ear-rings (did she sleep
as well as eat and play in these adornments?); other
women, too, sat at the absorbing game.</p>

<p>“Are they really gambling?” Hildegarde had asked
the giant, the first time he found her in a group looking
on.</p>

<p>The giant had laughed and said, “Don’t they look it?”</p>

<p>“No. They are so—so quiet.”</p>

<p>“That’s when they’re plunging worst.”</p>

<p>“You mean they’re making large sums of money
here now, and take it like that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and losing, too, and take it just the same. It’s
only in books that gamblers gurgle and gasp.”</p>

<p>But even the cheerful giant had seemed to feel this
was no place for Miss Mar. “Aren’t you coming up-stairs?”
As she still lingered fascinated, “I’ve been
getting some oranges for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Out of a crate that’s bust.”</p>

<p>“Your crate?”</p>

<p>“Everybody’s crate.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde laughed. He was so exactly like a great
school-boy proposing a raid on an orchard. “I’ve got
oranges of my own,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes, but these are tangerines,” and he led the way.</p>

<p>Very few people up there in comparison with the
crowds in saloon and smoking-room. Mrs. Blumpitty
asleep under sodden blankets; a group of men, tarpaulin
over their knees, crouched in a sheltered corner smoking
pipes and talking plans; a furry apparition sitting near
the edge of the deck on a bollard—Ruth Sears in a long
wolfskin coat, barely out of reach of the rain, a very
solitary little figure bent over a book. Hildegarde went
by unsteadily, and as the ship lurched Ford O’Gorman
caught and saved her from falling. He kept hold of her
till he had anchored her safely aft among the crates of
fruit.</p>

<p>“I’m very glad you didn’t, but how was it,” said
Hildegarde, stripping off the loose jacket of a purloined
tangerine, “how was it you didn’t go by the <i>Congress</i>,
after all?”</p>

<p>To her astonishment the red of the sunburnt cheek
above her shoulder deepened and spread all over O’Gorman’s
face, but he spoke quite naturally, and even offhand.
“Oh, I was afraid I wasn’t going to get all my
freight on board the <i>Congress</i>.”</p>

<p>But that sudden red in so stalwart a visage lit a danger
signal. It was ridiculous to suppose, and yet, was
this going to be the trouble Louis Cheviot had dreaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
for her? She had up till then suffered no check in the
comfort of the giant’s cheerful companionship; but was
she being too much with him? She recalled Ruth Sears’
gentle but speculative eyes, raised a moment from “The
Little Minister,” to follow the pair as they passed.</p>

<p>“I’m going to talk with Mrs. Blumpitty’s niece
awhile,” Miss Mar announced suddenly. The giant
stared. With a conscious effort and a letting down of
spirits, Hildegarde turned from him, encountering Mr.
Matt Gedge, the sharp-faced young man who had been in
the crowd on the Seattle wharf and had satirized her
“bright idear” of looking after her baggage.</p>

<p>“Is O’Gorman,” he began, and then looking past her,
“—<em>thought</em> if the lady was here you wouldn’t be far.
Say!” he arrested Miss Mar. “Has he told you there’s
robbers aboard this ship?”</p>

<p>“Robbers? No! What makes you think—”</p>

<p>“There’s a woman down in the second saloon—all
she’s got in the world’s been swiped.”</p>

<p>“But they’ve started a collection for her,” said
O’Gorman.</p>

<p>“Yep, we’ve fixed up the collection and we’ve fixed
up a Vigilance Committee. Come along, it was your
idear, so let’s go and give her the money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can do that,” said O’Gorman. “But hold
on a minute. Make it sixty-six for luck.” He fished in
his pocket. “I guess she’s spent more than a dollar’s
worth of worry.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde stopped by the immobile figure still reading.
“That’s a good warm coat you’ve got,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes”—Ruth looked up with absent eyes—“but it’s
too long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is it! I should think it kept your ankles good and
warm.”</p>

<p>“Y-yes.” She looked at the unspeakably filthy deck,
and tucked the skirts of her coat tighter round her.</p>

<p>“I see the good of a short skirt here,” Hildegarde’s
eyes followed hers, “and it looks very nice on
you, too.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” said the girl, “if you don’t think it’s too
short.” Then she told Hildegarde about her life up in
Alaska, how she had traveled, and cooked, and nursed,
and hunted, and cured skins, and followed the trail; and
did each and everything the better for wearing a skirt
to the knee.</p>

<p>“But it’s hard after we’ve worked so, my aunt and
me, to see men looking at us in that way as if they
thought we were—were, you know, the wrong kind. Just
because we try to adapt ourselves to the life.”</p>

<p>“Some people might not understand; but surely these
men—”</p>

<p>With her head Ruth Sears made a little motion of
negative. Slight as it was, it admitted no supposition
of there being any doubt about the matter. “They’d
rather we all wore trailing skirts and diamond ear-rings.”</p>

<p>“It’s really rather nice of them, in a way,” said Miss
Mar.</p>

<p>But the one who had had the experience was less free
to discover in the charge a survival of the starved spirit
of romance. “That Mr. Tod,” Ruth went on, “he was
up there last year. I’ve cooked him many a dinner.
Only yesterday I heard him agreeing with a lot of men
that he wouldn’t like to see <em>his</em> daughter going about in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
such a short dress, and all the while he was talking he
was spitting on the deck.”</p>

<p>More here for the eye that could see than a base-mannered
churl discussing feminine attire. He, in his way,
was dealing with one of the important questions of the
age. Also he had on his side many a learned and fastidious
critic of society, for all that the great current of
the future was set the other way. Some inkling of this
last reached Hildegarde, and it reached her through a
dawning sense of her own unfitness. She would never be
in the vanguard with skirts kilted high for action. She
was one of those who would cling to the outworn modes.
For all that, she would for the rest of her life understand
some things better because of these strange days
in the microcosm of the ship.</p>

<p>While the third dinner was being cleared away, Hildegarde
looked into the music-room. A dilapidated
young woman, at the dilapidated piano, singing a comic
song, and the cross-eyed man accompanying on the flute.
A number of people sat about on the few rickety chairs
and the many boxes and bundles, listening in a kind of
painful trance, or passing back and forth over the
wooden lattice of the raised flooring between which and
the boards below escaped bilge-water slopped about with
the motion of the ship and too frequently came to the
surface.</p>

<p>Mrs. Locke was not there at all events. As Hildegarde
turned away from the noisome-smelling place a well-dressed
woman of about forty, who had been leaning on
the piano (undisturbed, apparently, by the highly abnormal
sounds it gave forth), followed Miss Mar to ask:
“How is the sick lady in your room?” Miss Mar knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
her interlocutor to be Mrs. David M. Jones, but they
had not spoken before.</p>

<p>“There are two still sick,” Hildegarde answered.</p>

<p>“I mean the one they’re afraid’s got smallpox?”</p>

<p>Miss Mar opened her wide eyes very wide indeed.
Even Louis had never thought of that chance. “I
hadn’t heard about it,” she said. And presently, “Do
you know where Mrs. Locke is?”</p>

<p>“I think she’s gone to get the doctor,” answered the
ex-governor’s wife. “I had meant to be in the room you
and she are in. Pretty satisfied now to be out of it.”
With which she returned to the festive scene.</p>

<p>Even Hildegarde, who was so little nervous, would
ordinarily have found her self-possession shaken by the
news that she had been sleeping for nearly a week within
two feet of so contagious and foul a disease; but she took
the information more quietly than can well be credited
by any one who has never cut the ties that bind us to
resourceful yet care-filled civilized life.</p>

<p>Those who have once severed the thousand threads find
not only some hardship and heartsoreness, but certain
natures find, too, the larger calm that only perfect acquiescence
gives. It is not all loss to be unable to run
from danger. You gain a curious new sense of the inevitableness
that lies at the roots of life, a sense smothered in
the country and forgotten in the town. And this calm
that walks the perilous places of our earth with its front
of untroubled dignity and its steadfast eyes, this gain
amongst many losses was not denied the girl faring North
for knowledge and for old devotion’s sake.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the steward said, Mrs. Locke was in her cabin.
As she went toward it, Hildegarde wondered if it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
written among the things to be that she herself should
die there, and would Louis be hearing one day how
they’d buried her in Bering Sea. She opened the door,
and there was the object of her quest looking on at a
strange and sufficiently horrible spectacle. Stretched
full length upon the floor, in her nightgown, lay the
Dutch woman speechless, with a face swollen and scarlet.
The ship’s doctor, standing astride of her huge hulk, bent
over and peering under the heavy eyelid, which he had
forced back with his thumb, looked into the rolled-up
eye. Hildegarde, with noiseless lips, made the question,
“Smallpox?” Mrs. Locke answered, in a low voice,
“Smallpox! No. Lack of self-control.” How this
worked out Hildegarde did not wait to inquire. It was
too ugly to see that big woman lying there under such
conditions, and the place smelt of alcohol.</p>

<p>But outside it was hardly better. The card players
had gathered like flies settling down upon the remains of a
feast, and at the end of the saloon three men were quarreling.
Through an atmosphere thick, horrible, rose the
angry voices. Was there going to be a fight? One
might face death, even from smallpox, and yet not know
quite how to accept life among sights and sounds like
these.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” said Mrs. Locke, catching
Hildegarde just outside their door. “You’re not afraid!
I tell you it isn’t smallpox.”</p>

<p>“I know. That’s not it.” The girl leaned against the
wall. Two of the angry men had combined against the
third. His chief means of defense seemed to be blasphemy.
They hurt the ears, those words. She felt an
inward twist of humiliation as she remembered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Louis had said rather than see a sister of his go to Nome
with the gold rush he’d see her—</p>

<p>“Then what <em>is</em> the matter?” asked the woman at her
side, watching her with an odd intentness. “I suppose
this isn’t the first time you’ve heard a man swear.”</p>

<p>“The matter is—I feel as if what I’d seen and heard
here would leave some sort of lasting stain. As if I’d
gone through filth and some of it would stick to me for
ever.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t. You’re only thinking of what some
man might think.” Hildegarde caught her breath with
the surprise of guilty recognition, as Mrs. Locke’s soft
voice insisted: “Knowing doesn’t hurt a woman. Not
the right sort of woman. But it does change us. You’ll
find life will always look a little different to you after
this.”</p>

<p>Bella had said something like that!</p>

<p>“It’s curious,” the woman went on, “how hard we
struggle to live up to men’s standard of our ignorance.
After all, their instinct about it is quite right.”</p>

<p>“Instinct about what?”</p>

<p>“That if we knew the truth, the truth would make us
free.”</p>

<p>“The truth might make frightened slaves of some of
us.”</p>

<p>“Only of the meanest.”</p>

<p>“And you think men don’t want us free?” Hildegarde
asked wearily.</p>

<p>“A very few may. There are more of the other sort.”</p>

<p>“Well, I know one man,” said the girl, cleansing consciousness
with the vision, “one man who is the kind
you’d say was an exception. I’m sure his not wanting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
me to come on this journey was just a natural shrinking
from seeing any girl face hardships.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Locke set her fine little face like marble. “This
entire ship might have been full of girls facing hardships,
and it wouldn’t have cost him a pang. But I can
well believe your coming did.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you see, you don’t know him.”</p>

<p>The other shook her head. “Even the best men
haven’t got so far as to want to respect <em>all</em> women.
Their good-will, their helpfulness, are kept in watertight
compartments, reserved for particular women. The
rest may go to the everlasting bonfire.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it seems even to help them in being specially
nice to some—”</p>

<p>“What helps them?”</p>

<p>“To have been brutes to others.” Mrs. Locke turned
to go back into the horrible little cabin. “The best
fellow I ever met told me that no man knew how to treat
a woman who hadn’t stood over the grave of one he’d
loved.”</p>

<p>“Well, I say again, you don’t know the sort of man
I—Why, even that dreadful Matt Gedge—even he goes
and collects money for the poor woman in the second
class.”</p>

<p>“I never said they wouldn’t show kindness when the
notion took them. It’s justice they don’t understand.”
And with that she went back to the woman who was having
a fit on the floor.</p>

<p>Up on deck Hildegarde found a gale blowing. Where
was the giant? The chicken-merchant, joining Miss Mar
at the door, held on to his slouch hat while he inquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
significantly after the health of the purser. Miss Mar
had not heard he was indisposed? “Oh, yes, you ought
to go and see him. It’s nothin’ catchin’—calls it bronchitis.
Reckon it’s heart trouble,” and he cackled like
the most elated of his hens.</p>

<p>Again she came down-stairs, wandering aimlessly
about, and then stopping by a little knot of lookers-on
at the eternal game. In that childish mood, that may
once in a while fall upon even a reasonable girl, she
thought vaguely that if she stood long enough before this
spectacle held to be unfit for feminine eyes, the giant
would certainly come again and take her away. But
the giant did nothing of the kind, and presently she forgot
him. She usually forgot things when she watched
this particular group of players. She had been arrested
just here, unbeknown to the giant, a couple of nights
before on her way to bed. In front of where Hildegarde
stood, Governor Reinhart was giving up his seat to an
eagerly waiting claimant. “They are beginning to play
too high for me,” his Excellency observed affably to Miss
Mar.</p>

<p>“Who is winning?”</p>

<p>“That woman over there. She’s a holy terror.”</p>

<p>“Not that one with the gentle face and the pointed
chin?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Very pleasant and soft-spoken, too. Wife of
the man next—playing with the professional gambler
gang. They don’t tackle <em>her</em>. She’s a corker with the
cards!”</p>

<p>It was incredible that he should be speaking of that
singularly modest and well-bred-looking woman, who followed
the game with eyes that never lifted but once all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
the while Hildegarde stood there. It was when the last
of her husband’s shrinking pile of chips was swept from
him by the man opposite, that the woman, playing her
own stiff game, not looking right nor left, must still have
been acutely conscious of the full extent of the disaster
at her side. The loser’s only comment was “My deal!”
as he picked up the cards afresh. Then it was that she
turned the white wedge on her pointed face, laid a hand
on the dealer’s arm, and quite low, <em>“Don’t</em> Jim!” she
said, as though she hoped to influence him with her own
hand full of cards. Naturally, he paid no heed, and
each in the death-like silence, each went on with the
game. There was something almost unnerving to the onlooker
in the strained quiet of the woman. Was she
winning or losing now? No hint of which in the pointed
white mask, while she sat a little droop-shouldered, her
arms lying on the table as if paralyzed, moving only her
long supple fingers, gathering in or throwing out—unless
she dealt, and even then moving about a tenth as much
as any one else on either side up or down the long board.
After what Governor Reinhart had said, each night on
her way to bed, Hildegarde had paused a fascinated instant
watching this woman; or by a group lower down
where Curlyhead’s father was, often with his little boy
on his knee. While the elders played, the five-year-old
would sit quiet as a mouse staring wisely at his father’s
cards, seeing in them his first picture-book, learning
them for his earliest lesson.</p>

<p>Hildegarde had watched it all before, but on this particular
wet evening the spectacle assailed an unpanoplied
spirit. It was horrible. She would never get the picture
out of her head. Even when she should be at home again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
doing delightful things with dear and happy people,
she would remember this and the light would go out of
the day. For it would be going on still. Somewhere,
there would be people like these wasting and besmirching
the flying, irrecoverable hours. Women, too, <em>women</em>!
Something choked in her throat. She felt that she must
strike the table and cry out: “Listen, listen! You
haven’t ever heard. Life is beautiful and good, and
you’ve never known that—poor, poor people. But I
have come to tell you. Stop playing with those pieces
of painted paper and listen to my good news!”</p>

<p>But of course they’d only think she was mad. Oh,
why had she come! With a tension as of tears, crowding,
straining the muscles of her throat, she turned
away to face again the wind-driven sleet of the deck.
She dragged her steps to the dirty companionway. From
the smoking-room above came the giant’s great laugh,
punctuating some one’s story, and what so melancholy
to certain moods as the sound of distant merriment! It
becomes for us the symbol of all that greater gladness
out of our reach, attainable to happier men. No light
as yet, except in the saloon behind her. All the rest of
the ship shrouded in the early-gathering shadows of a
stormy evening. A passion of loneliness swept over her.
As her foot touched the first step, some one came close
behind.</p>

<p>“Is that you?” said a voice she did not recognize. A
touch, a whisky breath blowing foul in her face, and
without lifting her eyes or even uttering a sound she fled
up the stair, meaning to make straight for Mrs. Blumpitty’s
rain-soaked pallet. Half-way up she saw in the
gloom above her the blaze of a match, and there was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Arctic Cap, his back turned to her, holding up the
lighted match to read the run on the notice board. As
Hildegarde’s eyes fell in that vivid instant on the square
shoulders, something in outline or attitude set her heart
to beating so wildly, that, still flying on, she stumbled.
With a little cry she put out a hand and felt herself
steadied as the match fell to darkness. In a turmoil of
wonder and wild hope her cheek had brushed the coat
sleeve one lightning instant before she recovered firm
footing and stood erect with apology on her lips.</p>

<p>The ship’s doctor and the purser came hurriedly out
of the smoking-room. But the Arctic Cap was turned
away when the sudden light streamed out. A banging
door, hurrying steps, and Hildegarde was peering in the
dark after an indistinguishable face, hoping things she
knew both impossible and mad, only to find herself standing
there alone, with thumping pulses.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Arctic Cap had vanished from the ship.
Every one else able to be afoot appeared on
deck the next morning in the clear and
strangely milder weather. Even the purser
was abroad, passing by with averted eye, receiving
haughtily the homage of the fair who hastened to
inquire after his health, thereby further emphasizing
Miss Mar’s neglect. She sat watchful but silent in the
sunshine, drinking in the air that seemed to bring a blessing
with it from some golden land that yesterday had
been far off, and that to-day was very near. Mrs. Blumpitty
had resumed the perpendicular and her most cheerful
air. All the Blumpitty “outfit” in the best of spirits.
The business woman to the company was exhibiting her
vaunted competency in “dealing with men” and “affairs”
by industrious prosecution of her flirtation with
the oldest dentist. Shifting groups of lawyers, “judges,”
senators, were cheerfully objurgating the mining laws.
The lean bean-feaster, who between meals was for ever
chewing gum, paused in his nervous pacing of the deck,
though not in his labor of mastication, to assure ex-Governor
Reinhart that he was “dead wrong.” This
seemed, on the face of it, improbable. But Reinhart
condescended to remind him, “Nome isn’t like any other
camp. Wait till you see the state of things <em>there</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have.”</p>

<p>“Been there?”</p>

<p>The bean-feaster had an audience before you could
wink, for he had nodded, chewing harder than ever. Then
a pause long enough for him to say modestly, “I’m the
man appointed by the Nome miners to go in the commission
to Washington and report.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you go?”</p>

<p>“Did. Coming back now.” With immense respect all
within earshot listened to the disquisition on Alaskan
mining laws, and the bean-feaster’s modest assurance
that through his exertions they were being amended.</p>

<p>Some one aft in the steerage was playing the fiddle,
and a couple of darkies were dancing. The older woman
is Mrs. L’Estrange’s cook, and Mrs. L’Estrange is the
Southern lady of fallen fortunes who is going, with a
store of fine damask and all her family silver, to open a
high-class boarding-house at Nome! She had read of
Mrs. Millicent Egerton Finney, who, in the Klondike, by
this means, had made a “pile.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Locke’s admirer, Mr. Meyer, was displaying a
small working model of a superfine contrivance, only to
discover that every man on the ship had a superfine
contrivance of his own which was the grandest thing
on earth in the way of gold-saving. Many of the people,
as they moved from group to group, greeted Mrs. Locke
and Miss Mar; but to Hildegarde’s intent eye all other
faces were just merely not the one under the arctic cap.</p>

<p>Her companion watched the whale birds that swarmed
so low this morning over the water. Every now and
then a fountain spouted up into the sunshine.</p>

<p>But when Hildegarde, distracting herself an instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
from her own watch, said, “Do you suppose it’s true
those birds feed off barnacles on the whale’s back?”—Mrs.
Locke’s little concern for what she stared at was
evident in her answering, “There’s one thing I don’t
understand.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to have much to say to your friend,
the purser.”</p>

<p>“My friend?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t my friend.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“What made you think—”</p>

<p>“Merely that he seemed to be when you came on
board.”</p>

<p>“You mean because he let me get into my room before
the crowd came?”</p>

<p>“Well, that was real friendliness, but it wasn’t what
I meant.”</p>

<p>“What did you mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I only thought, since you called him by his Christian
name, he might be a friend.” The tone conveyed
the widest latitude—the most varied experience of other
women’s vagaries, or their weakness.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> called him by his Christian name!” ejaculated
Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“When in the world?”</p>

<p>“That very first night.”</p>

<p>“You must be dreaming.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Locke shook her head. “Of course it’s no crime.
I didn’t mean that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>“Crime? No. It would have been lunacy. But I
never did it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Locke opened a little book that lay in her lap.</p>

<p>Hildegarde leaned forward. For the first moment
since waking she forgot the Arctic Cap. “Do help me to
understand. What did I say?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Locke’s clear brown eyes looked into the earnest
face of the girl, and then a little unwillingly, “It wasn’t
in the least my business,” she added.</p>

<p>“What did you think you heard?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t the purser come to the door asking if Miss
Mar was ‘all right’? And didn’t you call out, ‘Is that
you, Louis?’ and didn’t you run after him?” As Hildegarde’s
perplexed face yielded to a gleam of horrified
enlightenment, “Of course it wasn’t any business of
mine,” Mrs. Locke repeated, and looked intently at the
sea-birds flocking in a new place.</p>

<p>“Do you—do you mean you think his name is—”</p>

<p>“I don’t think. I know his name is Louis Napoleon
Brown.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde gasped out, “Then that was why!”</p>

<p>“Why—”</p>

<p>“Why he was so—surprising. <em>His</em> name daring to be
Louis! The <em>purser</em>! Oh, dear. Oh, <em>dear</em>,” and the girl
began suddenly to laugh, and grew more and more convulsed
the longer she thought about it, till she became
hysterical. Mrs. Locke looked gravely at her, even
frowning slightly.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear. Oh, dear. He thought I meant him. Oh! oh!”</p>

<p>“You didn’t?”</p>

<p>“And you think you know the world. You called me
an infant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I own I never could make it square with the
rest of you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I must make you understand. You see I was expecting
a great friend of mine—an old friend of all our
family was coming to see me off; at least, I hoped he was.
When I heard that somebody was asking for me, I was
sure it was—” Up and down the deck her eye went
roving. She lowered her voice—“a man called Louis
Cheviot.” And she told Mrs. Locke what he was like,
this old friend. “You see the reason I jumped so quickly
to the conclusion he was asking for me, is that he never
before failed me. He’s been a quite uncommon sort of
friend. He’s the man I’ve once or twice mentioned.”
(Mrs. Locke kept her lips from smiling, “once or
twice!”) “Though I never said what his name was. I
told you about his hunting up my father and staying
with him all those months; about his coming out with
dogs over the ice, just to bring us word; and that kind
of thing. He’s a very particular friend of all of us.
And then he’s the most wonderful company. He makes
you always see the fun of things. And you—Yes, life
is always more interesting, somehow, when he’s there.
Did you ever know anybody like that?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t, after all, come to see you off. Yes, I’ve
known some one like that.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde turned her head suddenly. Up the deck
and down the deck the wide eyes vainly traveled. How
had it come that she had felt so sure? What had she to
go on? A likeness in the shoulder outline. Something
the same trick in the carriage of the head. A pang
shot through her. “Yes,” she said, as though agreeing
that he had failed her, “I’ve often said to myself, ‘To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
think of his never even saying good-by.’” (Yet she had
been imagining—A dullness fell upon her that was
worse than acute disappointment.) “He was angry,”
she went on. “We had quarreled, because I would go
to Nome.”</p>

<p>“He was right and you were wrong,” said Mrs. Locke.</p>

<p>Hildegarde smiled. She rather liked this woman for
veering round and taking his part. “Well, all the same,
I thought it wasn’t very nice of him not to send me any
sign of forgiveness at the last. And the odd thing is”
(her spirits revived a little in the act of talking about
this old friend) “it was so unlike Louis Cheviot. He can
be rather severe, but he never sulks. He’s the kind of
person” (Hildegarde had no idea how often she had said
“he is the kind of person”), “the kind that always looks
after his friends. And no matter how badly they treat
him he goes on looking after them. He was like that
even when he was little. His sister once told me a thing
about him that just shows you what kind of—He was
seven years old, Barbara said, and the most fiery little
patriot you ever heard of. And in other ways, yes, I’ve
often thought there could never have been a little boy
so like the grown man as this child was like the Louis
Cheviot I know.” She said it with an air of one making
an effective point.</p>

<p>“Is that so?” said Mrs. Locke, telling herself she
hadn’t realized how handsome the girl was until this
morning.</p>

<p>“Just to give you an idea. He had a perfect passion,
his sister says, for making a noise. Yes, but more than
any boy she ever knew. You had only to say fire-crackers
to make Louis explode with enthusiasm. The only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
reason he wanted to grow up was so that he could get a
gun, and he’d rather let off torpedoes than eat pie. No
picnic or birthday or holiday of any sort was the real
thing unless he could make a fearful rumpus. And the
day he lived for the year round was the Fourth of July.
Yes, yes, I know most American boys are like that, only
Louis was more so than any boy you ever heard of. So
his sister says. Well, I forgot to tell you when he was
two his father died awfully in debt. For years the Cheviots
were so poor they didn’t always have enough
bread. So they were naturally pretty short of fire-crackers.
And for those early years poor little Louis
had to get his fun out of other boys’ noise.”</p>

<p>“Ah, the thing is to make it yourself.” Mrs. Locke
spoke with the accent of one who makes the wider application.</p>

<p>“Of course.” Hildegarde nipped the generalization
in the bud. “Well, he learned very early that if he was
to have even a little Fourth of July he had to save up for
it. And he did. When he got a nickel or two he
wouldn’t waste it on candy, and he didn’t even buy
chewing-gum. Just saved up for July. The year he was
seven his mother had to give up trying to live in part of
their nice big house. They moved into a very small cottage
on the other side of the garden. But Louis and his
cousins, and the rest of the little boys of the neighborhood,
were going to have the greatest and most glorious
Fourth they’d any of them ever known. The others had
toy pistols and rockets and little cannon. Louis had
saved up and had got some fire-crackers and two little
flags, and he was going to make things hum. Well, there
was a man who had just moved into the Cheviots’ big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
house and nobody liked him, but I expect they wouldn’t
have liked anybody who lived in that house without being
a Cheviot. And he had a little boy about Louis’s
age. And the little boy was very ill. Scarlet fever.
Well, on the evening of the third (you know they never
can wait till the Fourth), the boys all over town began
to celebrate, but they were going to celebrate most just
in front of Louis’s house, for that was where the great
fight was to be—the battle, you know, where they were
going to beat the British all over again. It was always
more fun, and lots more noise and slaughter if Louis
was one of the generals. So they came trooping down
the street after supper, letting off torpedoes by the way.
And when Louis heard them he tore out with his flags
and his crackers, wild with excitement. And he lined
the boys up and told them where the red-coats were in
ambush behind the wood house. Louis had lit some
punk, and the new neighbor came rushing out just as a
big cracker went off with a bang. Barbara Cheviot was
on her side of the laurel and she saw the man throw up
his hands as though he’d been shot, and then make for
Louis exactly as if he meant to strike him. Barbara was
scared for a moment. But by the time the new neighbor
got to where the boys were he was holding himself down
pretty well. Barbara heard him speaking quite kindly.
What were they going to do, and that kind of thing.
And when they told him, Barbara says a sound like a
little groan came out of his tight lips, and he looked up
at the window where the curtains were drawn. But he
asked the boys how many more crackers they had. And
when he saw what a lot there were, he only said that was
fine to have so many. When he was a little boy he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
to share one pack with three brothers. And he said he
hoped they knew what the Fourth of July meant and
why they had a right to be proud and make a noise.
Louis answered up and told him. The man said ‘Good,
good!’ He didn’t want to put a stop to the fun, he
said. He was only thinking about the little boy up in
that room there, who wasn’t having any Fourth of July
at all this year. He was ill. So ill he might never see
another July. Yes, he was probably dying, and Barbara
says, he couldn’t go on for a minute. He had to wait.
And all the little boys looked down at the ground.
‘There’s just a chance, I think,’ the father said, ‘if he
sleeps to-night, just a little chance—if you boys would
celebrate on the other side of the town. And I’d be
very much obliged to you,’ he said. As he was going off
he turned to Louis and asked him if he’d tell all the
boys he saw, and try to keep them from coming into
this street. Louis said, Yes, he would, and the man
went back to his child. But he didn’t go to bed—just
sat in the sick-room and watched. The oddest thing
about that third of July was that Mrs. Cheviot and the
girls slept the whole night through. It was the only year
of their lives <em>that</em> ever happened. There wasn’t a
sound in their street. But the man in the big house was
too anxious and miserable about the sick child to notice
or remember anything outside that room where they
were all watching. Just before sunrise the crisis was
passed, and the doctor, who’d been sent a long way for,
and had been watching, too, said the fever had gone
down and the boy was saved. The father came out for
a breath of air. In the grayness he saw something moving
down by the fence. ‘Who’s that?’ he called out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and when he got close up he saw a little figure patroling
the dim street. ‘Why, aren’t you the boy—’ he began
to say. ‘Yes,’ Louis told him, ‘I’m doin’ what I said.’
‘What you said?’ The man didn’t remember even then.
‘Yes,’ Louis said, ‘I’m bein’ a sort o’ watchman to see
the boys don’t make a noise just here.’ And he had a
bunch of fire-crackers in his hand and two little flags in
his hat.”</p>

<p>With suffused eyes the girl looked out across the shining
water. The old story had a new significance for her,
if none at all for Mrs. Locke.</p>

<p>“It was, as I began by saying, more exactly like the
Louis Cheviot I know than a whole book of biography
might be. It’s because he’s precisely like that to this
day that I was so surprised when he let me go off without
a word, because, you see, he’d been ‘sort o’ watchman’
for us, too. It’s easier to believe that nothing else
will do for him but just to see you through.” She turned
her head, and her grasp on the railing tightened—nothing
else had done! For that figure outlined against the
sky—no use any longer that he turns his collar up above
his ears, no efficient mask any more the arctic cap. That
was the “watchman” yonder on the bridge, standing
guard over the fortunes of Hildegarde Mar!</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? What <em>is</em> it?” asked Mrs. Locke.</p>

<p>“Only—only that the most wonderful thing that ever
happened is happening right now.”</p>

<p>“What’s happening?”</p>

<p>“The man I’ve been telling you about—he’s there!”</p>

<p>“Not that one on the bridge!”</p>

<p>“Hush. ’Sh. Don’t stir. I must be very quiet.”</p>

<p>“Because you aren’t sure?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because I am. Oh-h—”</p>

<p>Mrs. Locke looked steadily into Hildegarde’s face for
an instant, before she turned away.</p>

<p>The girl leaned forward. “No, no. It’s not <em>that</em>,”
she said, and from under the brim of her hat she sent
another glance to the figure against the sky. “He’s
made a lot of money in the North—he has all kinds of
business interests up here.”</p>

<p>“How long have you known he was on board?”</p>

<p>“I almost think that in the back of my head I suspected
before, but I didn’t know till last night. And I
wasn’t <em>sure</em> till this minute,” she added, with girl’s
logic.</p>

<p>“You haven’t spoken at all—you two?”</p>

<p>Hildegarde shook her head.</p>

<p>“Why do you think he wants to spy on you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Louis doesn’t want to <em>spy</em>.” Her tone convicted
the suggestion of rank absurdity. “I told you
he’s been dreadfully angry. Too angry to write. Perhaps
too angry to speak.” Was that it? Again the upward
glance. “But”—she clutched at the inalienable
comfort—“it’s Louis Cheviot.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t be too certain this time, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Not be certain? But that was just what she must be.
Another quick look, and lo! the bridge was empty.
“I’m quite, quite sure—but I—I’ll just go and see.”</p>

<p>He was standing near the door of the chart-room. As
Hildegarde’s head came up the figure vanished. When
she reached the threshold there it was, back turned to the
door, cap bent over a map. Incredible to her now that
she hadn’t known him all along; but, nevertheless, she
stood wavering, seized by something else than mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
excitement—a wholly unexpected shyness. Was he indeed
nursing that old anger against her? Was it conceivable
he wanted to avoid her the whole voyage? She half
turned back, telling herself that at all events something
was the matter with her tongue—it was a physical impossibility
for her to speak. Then the next thing was, she
heard her own voice saying quite steadily, with even a
faint ring of defiance, “It’s no use! I’ve found you out!”</p>

<p>The figure flashed about, and Hildegarde caught the
shine in the black-fringed eyes as he pulled off the cap,
leaving his hair ruffled. He held out his hand, laughing,
but, as it would almost seem, a little shamefaced.
“Well, it took you long enough.”</p>

<p>“No wonder!” She felt an imperative need to prevent
her gladness from appearing excessive. “You can’t
ever say again there’s nothing of the actor in you.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t I?”</p>

<p>“After masquerading all these days?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to masquerade.”</p>

<p>“Why did you go about in that horrid cap then, and
never speak to me, or—”</p>

<p>“Oh, I never meant to stay incog. I was only waiting—”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“My opportunity; and it never came.”</p>

<p>“What opportunity?”</p>

<p>“Well”—he leaned against the lintel, and he was
smiling in that old whimsical way of his—“I suppose
what I was waiting for was your getting into some sort
of scrape.”</p>

<p>“You were hoping for that!” but while she denounced
him, she, too, was smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I had prophesied it. I suppose a prophet usually
has a weakness for seeing his wisdom verified.”</p>

<p>She laughed out as light-heartedly as though the journey
had been without care or cloud. “And you didn’t
like your prophecy not to come true. Poor false prophet!
No wonder you hid your face.”</p>

<p>“Yes, as for pretending—no, it isn’t any earthly use.
The truth is, I expected that very first evening to step
in at some psychological moment.”</p>

<p>“Save-my-life sort of thing?”</p>

<p>“Well, save you some anxiety or discomfort at the
least. But you were the one passenger on the ship who
didn’t suffer the one or the other.”</p>

<p>(Ah, he didn’t know! And she wasn’t going to tell
him. Oh, dear, no!)</p>

<p>“I go to see about your baggage. It’s checked, and
on the ship. I curry favor with the captain, so as to get
you a seat at the first table. You’ve got one for yourself.”</p>

<p>“No. <em>I</em> didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, whoever got it, you sit in it. Same thing on
deck. While I’m looking for a sheltered place for your
chair you are established. I bring special provisions to
keep you from starvation. You are somehow as well
supplied and with as exactly the right things as though
you’d made the trip twenty times.”</p>

<p>“It was the Blumpittys,” Hildegarde began.</p>

<p>“The whattatys? Never mind. Call it any name you
like. <em>I</em> couldn’t have promised you new-laid eggs every
morning for breakfast a thousand miles from land. I
could only hang about ready to save you from unpleasantness.
But, God bless me, unpleasantness never comes
within a league of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>“The purser,” Hildegarde prompted, with a gleam of
eye.</p>

<p>But he tossed the suggestion aside with, “A little
over pleasantness that you’re able to check for yourself.”</p>

<p>“It’s plain I’m not the stuff romantic heroines are
made of.”</p>

<p>He didn’t contradict that. “You certainly haven’t
given me much excuse for coming along.”</p>

<p>She was glad he wasn’t looking her way at that moment.
It was like him to declare his mission so simply,
and yet he stood there in the sunshine, smiling philosophically,
as he turned down his collar, saying, “The
merest superfluity. That’s what I am. Except,” he
added more seriously, “that if I hadn’t come I should
never have believed I was so little needed. So it turns
out that what I’ve come for is my own enlightenment.”</p>

<p>“Not only your enlightenment,” and her eyes invited
him to understanding of a friend’s gratefulness to a
friend. But he lifted his bare head to the breeze that
swept in with the sunshine at the open door, as though,
having delivered himself of his grievance, he could think
of nothing now but the comfort of being free of that all-enveloping
cap. His eyes seemed to shine only for joy
in the sun, as he stood there ruffling still more his short,
wavy hair—the hair that did, as Bella said, “fit” him so
uncommonly well. And he certainly looked as little sentimental
as some sturdy mountain pine.</p>

<p>“Some people,” Hildegarde remarked in a detached
tone, “would think it was a waste for two old friends—we
might have had all these days together.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I give you my word I never meant—” He
seemed to intend an apology as though he assumed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
deprivation to be chiefly, if not solely, hers. “The very
first time I passed you I thought, of course, you’d find
me out. Then, as you didn’t. I kept putting off—Morning,
Captain.”</p>

<p>“Morning!”</p>

<p>“I should think you did keep putting off!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t want you to”—he lowered his voice—“I
didn’t want to take you by surprise before people.”</p>

<p>“You thought the joy might be too much for me?”
she demanded.</p>

<p>Cheviot looked at her with the swift speculation in his
eye of the man who is thinking: “Now, is she going to
insist on quarreling with me?” “This is the lady I was
talking to you about, Captain. Pretty cool of me having
her up here without asking you! Miss Mar—Captain
Gillies. Now, the least I can do is to take her down,”
and, in spite of the captain’s gruff civility, that was
what Cheviot proceeded to do. “Don Quixote’s signaling.
Let’s go and see what’s up.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde had not perceived that the gaunt old person
below was making any unusual demonstration. He
was always waving his arms and addressing the multitude.
“I’ve been rather afraid of that one,” she confided.</p>

<p>“Afraid? Then it’s only because you don’t know
him. He’s the most interesting person on the ship.”</p>

<p>“No, my Blumpitty’s the most interesting.”</p>

<p>“Well, you show me your blumpitty and I’ll show
you mine. Mine’s got an invention for pumping water
for the placers.”</p>

<p>“Mine’s got something far more wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe you. Wait till you know about Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
Quixote’s ‘systems of windmills’; they’re the greatest
ever. I don’t say his windmills will work at the mines;
but they’ve gone without a let-up, straight through the
North Pacific and the Bering Sea. Windmills all the
morning. Windmills every night. You must have heard
as you passed him on the deck, ‘Windmills,’ ‘Windmills.’
No? Well, come along.”</p>

<p>Rather nice to be “coming along” with Louis once
more. It was going to make a difference in this expedition.</p>

<p>Hildegarde got a compliment to her seamanship out of
the fantastic old Alabaman. “I’ve watched this young
lady,” he informed Cheviot. “She’s as happy in a
‘norther’ as one o’ my windmills.” And he sent a rattling
laugh after them as they two went down the
swinging deck.</p>

<p>“How different everybody looks to-day—it’s the sunshine.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think they <em>do</em> look different.” But he did
not say it was the sunshine.</p>

<p>“I don’t see my Blumpitty, nor, what’s more important,
Mrs. Locke.”</p>

<p>“That’s the woman you’re so much with?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It looks as if she’d gone below.” What did it
matter? Nothing mattered now. Miss Mar had a distinct
sense of repressing a quite foolish sense of radiant
content, not to say elation. How this having a friend
along lit up the rude and sordid ship! Not the first
time this particular friend had wrought this particular
miracle in her sight. The fact that Louis’s eyes rested
on things constrained them to reveal an “interestingness”
unsuspected before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>“There are my three financiers,” she whispered.
“They aren’t as splendid as your Don Quixote, but
they’re very nice to me at table.”</p>

<p>“I’m relieved to hear you’ve found some one who
contrives to be ‘nice’ there. I’ve wondered how you
were getting on,” he chuckled.</p>

<p>The temptation to confess was strong upon her. But
no. Even Louis would be obliged to say, “I told you
so.”</p>

<p>“At first,” she said, with the detached air of the investigator,
“I watched my neighbors, because <em>everything</em>
they did was so surprising. But by and by I got so I
could see nice distinctions and fine shades. Some of the
roughest-looking haven’t by any means the roughest
manners.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve discovered that, have you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. This man here”—it was necessary to draw
close and to whisper again—“he’s Mr. Simeon Peters,
from Idaho. He shouted across the table to me at dinner
yesterday to pass the butter. He was just plunging his
own knife into it as everybody at our table does.”</p>

<p>“As everybody at every table does,” Cheviot corrected.</p>

<p>“Well, but wait. You don’t know how elegant we are
down at our end. Mr. Sim Peters hesitated, and you
could see a misgiving dawning behind his spectacles.
He drew back just before he reached the butter-dish, and
carefully and very thoroughly he licked his knife the
whole length of the blade. Yes! Then he felt quite
happy about plunging it in the public butter.” She was
able to laugh now at what had driven her from the table
in that dark yesterday. Louis laughed, too; he even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
carried his genial good-will the excessive length of joining
in the conversation of those same financiers.</p>

<p>“Did you succeed in getting your plant on board?”
he asked the nearest of the trio.</p>

<p>“Yes. But we had to pay another fellow to take off
half his stuff to make room for ours,” said financier
number two.</p>

<p>“What process have you got?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the McKeown,” said number three.</p>

<p>“And it’s the greatest ever?”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said all three together.</p>

<p>But why, Hildegarde wondered, why did he talk to
financiers, when he might talk to her?</p>

<p>“Them innercents think that about the McKeown,”
said a grizzled man across Cheviot’s shoulder, “only
jest becuz they ain’t never seen the Dingley workin’.”</p>

<p>“You got the Dingley?” Cheviot asked; just as though
it mattered.</p>

<p>“No good goin’ to Nome ’nless y’ <em>have</em> got the Dingley.”
And while Cheviot lingered to hear just why it was the
Dingley could “lick creation,” Hildegarde leaned against
the stanchion, watching him with that interest the better-born
American woman commonly feels in seeing something
of what she has less opportunity for than any
member of her sex in Europe, viz., the way her men folk
bear themselves with men. She had the sense that
again the American enjoys in its quiddity, of making
acquaintance with a new creature, while observing her
old friend in this new light. Cheviot was not only at his
ease with these people, he put them at ease with him.
They were content to reveal themselves, even eager before
the task. Was it because he looked “a likely customer,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
or did men commonly turn to him? Now Mr. Isaiah
Joslin and his sour-dough friend were pushing in between
Hildegarde and the group where Cheviot had been
buttonholed. Joslin was scoffing at the Dingley as well
as the McKeown. “Yes, <em>sir</em>!”—he demanded Cheviot’s
attention by striking his fist in his palm under that gentleman’s
nose—“I’ll do more with a plain rocker that
any feller can make for himself out of a store box and
three sticks, than all these cheechalkers and their new-fangled
machines.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s so,” said a broad, squat Ohioan, the
man Hildegarde had noticed before, going about the
ship with a tiny bottle, a little square of sheet copper,
and a deal of talk. “Maybe that’s right. But you old
sour-doughs lost a terrible lot o’ leaf and flour gold
whenever you didn’t use amalgam plates in your rockers.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so easy gittin’ plates.”</p>

<p>“’Tis now!” said the Ohioan, producing, as it were,
automatically, his little square of copper and his bottle
of fluid.</p>

<p>“Quicksilver, isn’t it?” Hildegarde came nearer
Cheviot to ask.</p>

<p>“Quacksilver, I guess,” but still he followed the discussion
about the McKeown “process” as though Hildegarde
had been a hundred miles away.</p>

<p>“Now, you just time me,” the Ohioan was challenging
Cheviot. “I can silver-plate this copper in twenty seconds
by the watch.” And he did it. The only person
there who was not a witness to the triumph was the girl
whose clear eyes seemed to follow the process with a look
of flattering interest. Should she, after all, tell Louis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
not how glad, but just that she was glad of his coming?
Hadn’t he earned that much? Not that he seemed to
care greatly about acknowledgments from her. He
seemed to have forgotten her existence already, and they
hadn’t been together twenty minutes. All the simpler,
then!</p>

<p>“I tell you what!”—the Ohioan had raised his voice
and enlarged his sphere of influence—“I tell you there’s
a lot o’ poor prospectors would have been rich men to-day
if only I’d discovered sooner how to make amalgam
plates this easy and this cheap.”</p>

<p>“Cheap, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a damned lot cheaper than losin’ half your gold.
Cheaper than linin’ your rockers—yes, and your sluices,
too, with silver dollars as some fellers did. Now, this
little piece of copper”—he produced a new bit—“a
child can turn that into an amalgam plate by my process.
Here, let the lady show you.” Before Hildegarde
knew what was happening, the fragment of metal was in
her hand and the owner had tipped the tiny bottle till a
drop of the liquid ran out on the copper. “Quick! Rub
it all over.”</p>

<p>As she did so, she saw that Cheviot’s attention was
now undividedly hers. He did not look as if he altogether
approved her acting as show woman. But not
to disappoint the inventor, Hildegarde rubbed the silvered
tip of her finger lightly and evenly over the copper.
“Why, yes!” she cried out. “Look!” And as she held
up the miraculous result the Ohioan roared with satisfaction,
“Ain’t I been tellin’ you?” The copper was
turned into a sheet of silver. “Rub and rub as hard as
you like now”—he passed the object-lesson round—“you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
can no more budge a particle of that stuff than
you can rub off triple plate. And <em>that’s</em> what you want
to line your rockers with!”</p>

<p>“Looks like that silverin’ business might be worth
somethin’.”</p>

<p>“Worth a clean million,” says the Ohioan, as he
pocketed his bottle of miracle and walked jauntily away
in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Hildegarde and Cheviot, exchanging smiles, went on
down the deck in his wake. But suddenly the Ohioan
stopped and wheeled about in the direction of a voice
that had just said: “No, siree, I ain’t worrittin’ with no
Dingley and no nothin’ I ain’t never tried.” The inventor
of amalgam-plated copper, as though he’d heard
himself called by name, retraced his steps with a precipitation
that nearly capsized Miss Mar. The gentleman
who had just declined Dingley squared his shoulders
and announced to all and sundry: “No, siree! Y’
got to <em>show</em> me. I’m from Missoura.” Hildegarde
caught at Cheviot’s arm. “They’ve got hold of our
saying!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s everybody’s saying now,” he answered.
“I’ve heard it twenty times since I came on board.”
She waited, incredulous, listening. “If I got any minin’
to do,” the man from Missouri went on, “give <em>me</em>
Swain’s Improved Amalgamator every time. D’ye
know what they done to test Swain’s Improved Amalgamator?”</p>

<p>“Nop.”</p>

<p>“Well, lemme tell yer. They took a gold dollar and
they pulverized it.”</p>

<p>“I’ve pulverized many a dollar in my day,” says a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
gloomy and familiar voice. While the deck chuckled
with sympathy. Hildegarde whispered, “That’s my
Blumpitty.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” the other went on unmoved, “they passed
that dollar in gold dust that I’m tellin’ y’ ’bout, they
passed it through a sixty-mesh sieve, and they mixed it
good and thorough with a ton—a ton, sir, of gravel and
sand. And they run that through Swain’s Improved
Gold Amalgamator, and what do you think they
got?”</p>

<p>“Guess,” says Mr. Blumpitty, “they got to know that
any feller can pulverize a dollar—”</p>

<p>“Haw, haw.”</p>

<p>“—but it’s the daisy that can pick one up.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, Swain’s Improved Amalgamator’s jest
that kind of a daisy. It picked up jest exactly ninety-eight
cents out of that gold dollar.” And every owner
of a rival invention roared with derision.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Purser!” Louis Napoleon Brown was
hailed with a suddenness that arrested his steps, but did
not deprive him of his haughty mien. “I find I owe you
an apology,” said Miss Mar.</p>

<p>His sternness of visage relaxed slightly. “Well, you
have treated me mighty mean,” he admitted in a low
voice.</p>

<p>Cheviot was staring and making his way to the girl.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, with a subdued air that might, to the
purser, have seemed to be penitential, but she spoke so
that Cheviot could hear, “You must have thought it
very forward of me to call you ‘Louis,’ that first evening.
I meant this gentleman, who is an old friend of
mine. I’ve only just realized how mystified you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
have been.” Wherewith she took Cheviot’s arm, and
away the two went, leaving the purser transfixed.</p>

<p>Oh, the sun-warmed wind blowing in your face! Oh,
this seeing the brave world, with a friend at your side!</p>

<p>“I don’t remember you at meals,” she said to him.</p>

<p>“I never was at meals.”</p>

<p>“Where did you eat?”</p>

<p>“Up in the captain’s room.”</p>

<p>“Well, you won’t any more, will you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“You want us to eat apart!”</p>

<p>“I don’t ‘want.’ But I can’t turn anybody out of his
seat, and they’re all taken.”</p>

<p>Well, if he were content with this arrangement it
hardly behooved her to protest. “Come and be introduced
to my Blumpitty. I can tell from the look on his
face exactly what he’s talking about.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Come and listen.”</p>

<p>“Ya-as,” Blumpitty was saying, ostensibly to Governor
Reinhart, but really to a distinguished and rapidly
increasing circle, “Ya-as, queerest feller ever I see.”</p>

<p>“Who was?”</p>

<p>“Why, the feller I found dyin’ on the coast up above
Cape Polaris. The man that gave me the tip. I can see
that feller now. Couldn’t get his face out o’ my head
fur months. His eyes—used t’ see them eyes in my
sleep.” Blumpitty paused, and seemed to struggle
feebly with an incubus. “Never see such eyes in any
man’s head ’fore nor since.” Again he paused an instant
to think out something. “Reckon it makes a man
look like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>“What does?” demanded the Governor.</p>

<p>“Knockin’ up agin the Mother Lode.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the Mother Lode!” said Reinhart, slightingly.</p>

<p>“Ya-as; those of us that’s practical miners”—his
look weeded out the Governor—“guess we all know that
every bit o’ gold that’s found its way to the creek bottoms
and the coast, it’s all come from the Mother Lode,
off there in them low ground—down hills to the
North.”</p>

<p>The breathless respect with which this information
was received by the rest, was broken in upon by the Governor’s
roaring a great infidel laugh. “Why, Joslin,
here, tells me the gold comes out o’ the sea!”</p>

<p>“Maybe he believes it,” says Blumpitty, sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Believe it!” bellowed Isaiah, sticking his head over
Dr. Daly’s shoulder. “So’ll you believe it when you
get to Nome. The further out you go at low tide the
richer you’ll find it.”</p>

<p>Blumpitty’s pale-eyed pity for his delusion seemed to
get on Joslin’s nerves.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t I <em>there</em> when Jake Hitz and Tough Nut
went way out with a wheelbarra’?”</p>

<p>“Any man can go out with a wheelbarra’,” said
Blumpitty.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it ain’t every man can come back with pay
dirt and rock out what they did.”</p>

<p>Blumpitty just smiled.</p>

<p>“Twenty-two hundred dollars, sir!”</p>

<p>“Guess you weren’t watchin’ which way they went for
that dirt?” said one of the capitalists.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” laughed his partner. “Tough Nut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
must have got that twenty-two hundred out of the tundra.”</p>

<p>“Hope that isn’t where you fellows count on findin’
gold,” said Joslin, sympathetically.</p>

<p>“We just about are.”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know the tundra’s froze the year
round?”</p>

<p>“That’s why we’re takin’ up thawin’ machines—$90,000
worth.”</p>

<p>“Might as well take up ninety thousand pianners and
play toons to the tundra.”</p>

<p>As though this idea had some special significance for
him, a poorly-dressed boy detached himself from the
group with a cheerful whistling of the eternal Boulanger
march.</p>

<p>“There’s a hell of a lot o’ machinery goin’; I ain’t
sorry I’m takin’ in chickens m’self,” observed Hildegarde’s
table companion.</p>

<p>Cheviot caught the eye of the whistling boy as he went
by. “What are <em>you</em> taking in?”</p>

<p>The boy held up a banjo. “This!” he laughed, and
went briskly back to the dancers in the steerage.</p>

<p>Hildegarde smiled into Cheviot’s eyes. “Wasn’t
that nice?” How easily he made people say amusing, revealing
things. “Do you notice how happy everybody
looks to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he admitted. “The <i>Los Angeles</i> is a pretty
dismal place, but most of these people have been happier
on this horrible ship than they’ve been for years. Happier,
some of them, than they’ve ever been before.”</p>

<p>She didn’t quite like him to speak so of the <i>Los Angeles</i>.
Yesterday she would have agreed. But to-day—“How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
do you know they’re happier here?” (Shame
on him if <em>he</em> wasn’t. But it was just as well. Oh, much
simpler!)</p>

<p>“Talk to them and you’ll see. Everybody on the ship
has had the worst luck you ever heard of; and all
through ‘circumstances over which’!” His voice made
a period, with that old trick of assuming a phrase complete,
when you could finish it for yourself. “Even
those that look prosperous like you and me, they’ve all
failed at the main business of life.”</p>

<p>So far as she was concerned in this review she felt
only impatience at his going back upon old loss and
pain. What if you have been sorry and sad. It wasn’t
the part of a friend to remind you of it. But if Louis
must talk of failure here was a ship-load of it! She told
herself this thought was the hag that was riding her happiness
down. She looked round her. The world was a
pretty terrible place, after all, “for the mass,” that Mrs.
Locke had taunted her with not caring about. The wind
blew out a wisp of straight, fair hair till it played like a
golden flame above the brim of her hat of Lincoln-green.</p>

<p>“A whole ship-load of failure!” she said aloud. A
sense of the grim business life was for “the mass” pressed
leaden, and the scarlet mouth closed pitiful upon the
words, “Poor, poor people!” But Cheviot, with his
eyes on that beguiling little flame of gold, was ready to
reassure her. It didn’t matter if every soul on board
<em>had</em> seen unmerciful disaster follow fast and follow
faster, up to the hour he set foot upon the ship. Hildegarde
needn’t waste her pity. Look at their faces, listen
to them making incantations with McKeown and Dingley.
Anything would do to work the spell. Why? Because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
the place they were bound for had the immense
advantage of being unknown. No one could say of any
of these contrivances, “It’s been tried.” “Not a soul
on the ship but has his thawing machine or his banjo,
or—”</p>

<p>“Or her black cook.”</p>

<p>He nodded. How well they understood each other,
“<em>Some</em> talisman.”</p>

<p>“What’s ours?” said the girl quickly.</p>

<p>“Our what?”</p>

<p>“Our talisman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wasn’t thinking of us.”</p>

<p>“Think now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Well, I know what mine is.”</p>

<p>“You won’t tell me, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” She spoke lightly, even a little teasingly.
“It’s a sort of rough diamond, my talisman.
Or”—her sunny look flashed in his face—“perhaps it’s
adamant. Which is the most unyielding?” Then, with
sudden gravity, “It’s a wonderful thing, the trust you
make people feel. Nothing can shake it.”</p>

<p>“I thought we were talking about talismans.”</p>

<p>“It makes every difficult thing seem easy. And it
makes every dangerous thing seem safe.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s the very last effect I intend to produce!”</p>

<p>She swept his declaration aside. “Impossible to feel
anything can go very wrong now that you’re here.”</p>

<p>His face was so unmoved by this handsome tribute that
she found herself venturing further. “I don’t know
why I should pretend I don’t appreciate. I’ve been so
afraid these last days—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>He caught at that. “Afraid, were you?”</p>

<p>“Afraid that one of us two would die before I had a
chance to tell you.” Should she go on? She had meant
to write—it was different saying it.</p>

<p>“Tell me what?”</p>

<p>“That I’ve got over minding your having opposed
me so.” If she expected any outburst of joy on his part
she was denied the spectacle. “I’ve come to understand
such a lot of things on board this ship.” She waited an
instant, but he leaned over the railing quite silent, staring
down into the water. “Among other things,” she
went on, “I see when I look back that you’ve always
been the one to bring me strength. A feeling that I’d
set my feet upon the rock—”</p>

<p>“And it wasn’t rock, after all, what you set your feet
on,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>She tightened her hands on the railing, and something
like veiled warning crept into the words: “You’ve
made me feel <em>safer</em>, Louis, than any one else in the
world. I owe you a great deal for that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>owe</em>!” He turned away impatiently.</p>

<p>Not the sea-birds sweeping so low over the water that
their white feather brooms raised a dust of silver in the
sunlight; not the motley crew upon the ship half as clear
to the girl’s vision as that little figure with the flags in
his hat patroling a deserted street in the dawn. “One
reason people depend on you so is, I suppose, because
they see as I do, it isn’t only that you’re good to some
particular one. You’d be good to anybody.”</p>

<p>“Oh, would I!”</p>

<p>“Just as you gave up your Fourth of July to be
watchman for the neighbor’s boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>“How did you get hold of that yarn?”</p>

<p>“Barbara—”</p>

<p>“Well, look here”—he moved his square shoulders
uneasily, like one in an ill-fitting coat. “Look here, if
you’re thinking of trying to make a hero out of me—it
isn’t any earthly—”</p>

<p>“Hero? Nonsense. We were talking about talismans,”
she said, with recovered gaiety. “I haven’t
brought along a machine of any sort, and I haven’t got
a black cook. Not even a banjo! But I’ve got a friend!”
she triumphed. “So I can’t be scared now any more
than the rest of the wild adventurers.”</p>

<p>“Then you were scared?”</p>

<p>“Oh, here she is! Mrs. Locke! This is ‘the sort o’
watchman’ I was telling you about.”</p>

<p>In the act of holding out her hand, the woman’s delicate
face took on that marble look that once or twice
Hildegarde had seen there. And the hand dropped before
it reached Cheviot’s.</p>

<p>Hildegarde looked from one to the other. “Why,
what is it?”</p>

<p>“We have met before,” said Mrs. Locke.</p>

<p>“When was that?”</p>

<p>“On the Seattle wharf.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t remember.”</p>

<p>“I do. You are the man who nearly broke my arm.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-m.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Mrs. Locke had gone below and left them
staring at one another.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the smallest recollection of
the woman.”</p>

<p>She clutched at hope. “You couldn’t
have been the one.”</p>

<p>“<em>She</em> doesn’t seem to have much doubt about it.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t—I’m sure you didn’t.”</p>

<p>“I certainly did push my way about in that crowd.”</p>

<p>“So did everybody.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it stands to reason a man does that kind
of thing more effectually than a woman. Your Mrs.
What’s-her-name may be right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Louis!”</p>

<p>“If she is, I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“You simply <em>couldn’t</em> have—”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. I remember perfectly, I was
frantic at not finding you.”</p>

<p>Ashamed of the warmth his words brought welling up
about her heart—“And you didn’t think much of the
women you did find. Yes, I remember what you said
about the women who go on this sort of journey. But
you’re wrong, you see. I know them now.”</p>

<p>He made no answer. Just stood there, hands in pockets,
arctic cap rolled back, so that it sat turban-like on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
the crown of his head; the perplexity in the face giving
way to a somewhat dogged good-temper that declined to
be ruffled by the incident.</p>

<p>“Some of the women are just as—are more deserving
of being treated well than I am.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dare say some of them are all right.” He
leaned against the railing, his square chin lifted, and he
studied the man in the crow’s-nest—but he went on saying
in that cool way, “I’m not denying that I would
have broken any number of bones rather than not get to
you in time to save you from coming to harm.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>don’t</em> say it! That’s exactly what Mrs. Locke
thinks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Locke!”—he moved his shoulders impatiently—“I’m
sorry if she got hurt. But in my opinion
neither of you ought to have been there. Don’t think
my view about that is altered by your having come off
scot free so far. You see somebody did suffer.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Locke.”</p>

<p>“It’s just a chance it wasn’t you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see that it wouldn’t be a chance if men
treated all women as well as you’d have treated me?”</p>

<p>“Men would have to feel about all women as I feel
about you before that could come about, and that
wouldn’t even be desirable. It certainly isn’t practical
politics.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish I were clever and could argue. I know
there are things to say only I don’t see how to put
them.”</p>

<p>“There’s this to say”—he stood up, a little impatiently—“I’ve
never posed as a passive individual. If I
see things in my way I”—he made an expressive little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
gesture—“I set them aside. If I hurt Mrs. Locke in
setting her aside, I’m sorry. But women have no business
being in the way at such times.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to think you aren’t in your heart taking
it as lightly as you pretend.”</p>

<p>But the incident rather spoilt things. Instead of
being able to yield unreservedly to the comfort, yes, the
joy of his being there, a counter influence was at work.
A watchfulness, critical, even painful. Not so much of
Cheviot as of herself. <em>Was</em> she the kind of girl Mrs.
Locke had meant?—the kind who said, “I’m all right.
What does it matter about other women.” Something
in her soul revolted at the charge. In other moods she
was conscious only of a blind rebellion against this evil
trick fate had played her—perversely thrusting into the
foreground a thing so little representative of the man.
Offering this, forsooth, as a symbol of all that lay behind.
A lying symbol. He wasn’t like that. <em>Was</em> he?
He had been “frantic” about her. Ah, the subtle danger
of that solace, feeding self-love, divorcing her from
her less fortunate sisters.</p>

<p>Few people minded the lowering weather the next day,
since it brought a sight of land. Yet one had need to be
at sea for a week and a half to find comfort in this
vision of a dim gray rock rising out of a gray sea to
starboard; or on the port side, a range of snow-flecked
hills, with clouds hanging low over the crater of an extinct
volcano. How bleak the world up here in the
Aleutians! Then suddenly, for Hildegarde, the chill
vision warmed and glowed. “This is the kind of thing
John Galbraith is looking at on the other side of the
globe!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>To every one’s huge satisfaction the <i>Los Angeles</i>,
skirting Ounalaska, showed no sign of pausing. Instead
of turning off toward Dutch Harbor to learn if the ice
had yielded up yonder and the way was clear, boldly the
ship took the short cut through Unimak Pass into the
Bering Sea. What splendid time they were making
under the convoy of this best of all captains! People
went about boasting, “Nome by Sunday!”</p>

<p>“We’ll make the record trip!”</p>

<p>“—Make the big fortunes!”</p>

<p>“We’ll beat creation!”</p>

<p>“Splendid fellow, our captain!”</p>

<p>Never such luck before in this bedeviled course.</p>

<p>Toward three o’clock the next morning Hildegarde
was waked by the noise of hurrying feet above her head
and a great hubbub in the saloon.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Locke?” Her berth was empty.</p>

<p>In the narrow cabin two half-dressed women were
agitatedly hunting their belongings, while the dressmaker,
Miss Tillie Jump, screamed through the door to
know if there was any danger.</p>

<p>“What’s happened?” asked Hildegarde, tumbling
down out of her berth.</p>

<p>“We are in the ice.”</p>

<p>“Masses all round us high as the ship.”</p>

<p>Certainly Mrs. Locke had vanished. “I’m very
calm,” said Miss Mar to herself, with a certain admiring
surprise. And then her self-esteem fell from her
with the realization that in the back of her head she
knew there could not possibly be any immediate danger,
or Cheviot would have made some sign. All the same,
her tranquillity did not prevent her from picturing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
shipwreck, in which the clearest impression was that of
Cheviot saving Mrs. Locke’s life at risk of his own. The
lady’s heartfelt acknowledgments and tableau.</p>

<p>On deck, in the gray milky light, a different picture.
No Cheviot and no discernible danger. Plenty of broken,
moving ice, but nothing like the towering bergs of saloon
rumor. Going forward at low pressure the <i>Los Angeles</i>
was picking her way among the water-worn shapes that
stood dazzling white, each on a pale green base, submerged
yet partly visible. Strange sculpture of the sea,
that, like a Rodin statue, gained meaning as you gazed.
This rough-hewn mass was a crouching polar bear; that
a saurian, antediluvian, vast. Some of the ice-cakes,
flat, featureless, were mere lonely white rafts drifting
from nowhere, bound nowhere; others manned by dwarf
snowmen, misshapen, spectral.</p>

<p>Though so unlike report, there was something here expected,
hauntingly familiar, like a single surviving impression
out of a vanished life. From a long, long
distance O’Gorman’s voice recalled her as he came down
the deck with Mrs. Locke. “What do you think of this
for a change?”</p>

<p>Hildegarde was still looking round for Cheviot, as
she answered, “It’s all much flatter and less tremendous
than I expected.”</p>

<p>“Three fourths of the ice is under water. I’m afraid
you’ll find it quite tremendous enough.”</p>

<p>Here at last was Louis! “What’s going to happen?”
Hildegarde hailed him.</p>

<p>He only pulled off his cap for her benefit. It was to
O’Gorman he said, half aside, “We’ll have to get out
of this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>While the two men stood there looking gravely out,
the ship put her nose into the ice-pack, shivered, and
drew back.</p>

<p>“What’s happening?”</p>

<p>“They’re reversing engines.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde had put her question with a dawning
sense of obscurer energies here at work than she had
apprehended, and with that the thought of Galbraith
took on a sudden something like its old ineluctable hold
on her imagination. These the forces that had fashioned
life for him. Yes, and for others, too.</p>

<p>The whole of that raw morning she haunted the upper
deck, for the most part alone. If Mrs. Locke avoided
her, it would seem that Cheviot was inclined to do the
same. He had struck up a friendship with O’Gorman.
They walked about or sat together in the smoking-room.
The feeling of tension that pervaded the <i>Los Angeles</i>
was manifest even in the Kangaroo Court. No livelier
precinct hitherto on the <i>Los Angeles</i> than this part of
the fo’c’sle, where, from the eminence of the judge’s
bench (a great coil of rope), Mr. Gedge imposed upon
his much-diverted public a parody of those forms of
legal procedure learned in his experience as a shorthand
reporter of “cases,” or, as he called himself, a court
stenographer. Gedge modeled his style upon those administrators
of justice who think because a man has
disobeyed one law, his fellow-creatures may with respect
to him (or rather without “respect”) break all rules
governing human intercourse. With the aid of unlimited
audacity and a ready tongue, Mr. Matthew Gedge
made things lively within the precincts of the Kangaroo
Court. And with impunity, for an unwritten law ordains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
that no one, however great a personage, shall dare
to defy the authority of the mock court, or can safely
set aside its judgments. Woe betide any one who seriously
persists in so unpopular a course. Whatever the
case being tried, no bystander, no unwary passer even,
but goes in peril of being summoned. If he know himself
unable to beat Gedge at the sharp word game, it
behooves the witness to bear himself meekly. If he
thinks to flee, let him expect to hear Gedge roar with
grim zest, “Constable! Do your duty. Arrest that
man!” and sometimes half way to cover the offender is
caught and haled back amid a general hilarity, to find
himself, however confused, speechless or unwilling,
clapped into the witness-box (a big iron boiler) and kept
stewing there while he meets as best he may a fire of merciless
questions and the bubbling merriment of the deck.</p>

<p>But to-day the sittings of the Court were suspended.
The loungers who came to Gedge for diversion or enlightenment,
got only a grumbled, “I pass!” or “Guess
we’re euchred!” And even such popularity as Gedge’s
was threatened with eclipse for putting into words the
silent misgivings of all men. The very sky looked evil.
The ragged gray-brown clouds had been racing across
the heavens like tatterdemalions hearing of mischief
afoot and eager for a share. Now they were massed
there in the southwest, a dirty, featureless mob, in which
the ineffectual units were lost and the whole fused into
a vast somber-hued menace.</p>

<p>The faithful Blumpitty sought out Miss Mar.
“No—o,” he drawled, rolling his eye among the fantastic
ice shapes. “No—o, it don’t look good to me, this don’t.”
But Blumpitty had news. “That feller who discovered—yes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
And wus dyin’ as hard as he could last fall.
Well, he’s alive yet.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Joslin says so. He had a letter at Seattle from a
man who’d come down to Nome from Polaris over the
ice at Christmas. Not that it matters much. The sick
feller don’t seem to have let on to them others. Anyways,
they’s good and plenty in the Mother Lode.
What I don’t see is how he managed it.”</p>

<p>“Managed what?”</p>

<p>“To hang on. If ever I see death in a man’s face!
But I always said they wusn’t like anything I ever
seen before.”</p>

<p>“What wasn’t?”</p>

<p>“<em>Them eyes.</em>”</p>

<p>“Near Nome, is it—the place where he—”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, a good ways north.”</p>

<p>“Heavens, north even of Nome?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s the farthest north camp they is. Think o’
him hangin’ on all through the winter. In that place!”
Blumpitty’s pale gaze sought vainly for enlightenment
among the moving ice masses.</p>

<p>“People do get through in worse places than that,”
said his companion.</p>

<p>“They ain’t no worse places than Polaris.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s Franz Josef Land.”</p>

<p>“Never heard o’ that camp.”</p>

<p>“I wish <em>I</em> were going as far as Polaris.”</p>

<p>“Why, come right along.”</p>

<p>She laughed. “I only wish I could. I’d like to know
a man who’d lived in the farthest north camp of all—the
farthest on our side. What’s that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Out there.” She pointed to a ghostly something,
faint as smoke against the high light of the ice rim on
the far horizon.</p>

<p>Blumpitty stared. “Reckon it’s a cloud. They’s
two more! And another. No, by gum, it’s ships!”</p>

<p>And ships they were, five of them, the first seen since
leaving Vancouver!—spectacle to stir the chilled blood
of watchers on the <i>Los Angeles</i>. For these dreamlike
apparitions were vessels such as theirs, threatened like
them with ice-pack and with storm. A detachment of
the Nome fleet! None came any nearer, except the <i>Ohio</i>
and the little <i>Charles Nelson</i>. They spoke and passed,
the Ohio speedily to vanish; <i>Charles Nelson</i> to tack
about, hunting an outlet, and then, discouraged, turn
south as the bigger <i>Los Angeles</i> pushed valiantly
through the ice to the North. “Turn back! No use!”
<i>Charles Nelson</i> warned, and then, quicker than ever you
saw in your life, the fog swooped down and wiped everything
off the ocean except the nearer ice. The <i>Los Angeles</i>
turned and tacked about to the tune of the fog-horn,
trying to find a way through the heavier floe, only to
be headed off by bigger masses looming through the haze,
majestic slow-sailing ice-ships, some like white gondolas,
some like sturdy, low-built castles set fantastically on a
field of fleece, for the exposed parts of the berg had
rotted in the sun, and in the wind been rippled, so that
a nearer sight showed the surfaces honeycombed, disintegrate.
And again to Hildegarde Mar came that sense of
its all being familiar, as though she had been here before.
So she had, in spirit. With a thrilling sense of recognition
she discovered the original of more than one picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
in that book of Galbraith’s that she and Bella had pored
over in their school-days.</p>

<p>When, early in the afternoon, the fog lifted a little, a
message came from the captain inviting Miss Mar to the
bridge that she might have a better view. By the time
she had obeyed the summons the wind had risen. The
captain was looking through his glass, and Mrs. Locke
was at his side. He left both visitors with harassed face
and called down to Cheviot walking below with O’Gorman.
And now Louis stood beside the captain on the
bridge, looking to the northeast, and talking in an undertone.</p>

<p>“What does he know,” said Mrs. Locke, referring to
Cheviot for the first time, “about navigation?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, I should think,” said Hildegarde serenely,
yet with that stirring of pride that visits a woman when
the man she is interested in is called to counsel. “You
see Louis has been up here before, and so few people
have.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Mrs. Locke turned indifferently away and looked
out over the white-patched water. The girl felt anew
and keenly the embarrassment that had come of the confrontation
of these two. Impossible for her to think it
didn’t matter. No vulgarity of soul helped her to meet
the issue with, “Mrs. Locke’s ‘nobody,’—a little book-keeping
woman we shall never see again!” She could
not even, as a feebler nature would, simply ignore the
incident of the day before, accepting for Louis Mrs.
Locke’s evil opinion, accepting for Mrs. Locke his
professed regret but real indifference, verging on dislike.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Hildegarde drew closer, “I’ve thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
a great deal about what happened yesterday—I mean
what happened on the wharf.”</p>

<p>“Oh, put it out of your head.”</p>

<p>“It’s hardly been out of my head a minute, except
the two hours I slept this morning.”</p>

<p>“I ought to have held my tongue.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you didn’t. Because now I know something
more than that he hurt you.”</p>

<p>“What do you know?”</p>

<p>“How much he can hurt <em>me</em>,” was on her tongue, but
the only answer she made was, “I mustn’t let you think
that I’m going to turn a cold shoulder on my friend
because—”</p>

<p>“Oh, no.” It was said not scornfully—just accepting
it.</p>

<p>“I think a month ago I would either not have believed
it or I would have explained it all away to myself. I’d
have said he didn’t know what he was doing. He—he
was—Oh, there are a dozen excuses I might have made
for him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dozens.”</p>

<p>“But now I don’t make one. I say, ‘Yes, he did it,
and he doesn’t even realize how terrible it was.’”</p>

<p>Mrs. Locke glanced at her curiously. “It’s true a
good deal has to happen before men and women can
treat each other fairly.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde nodded. “I’m beginning to see that.
Louis hasn’t begun—not yet. But about other things
he’s always been the one who’s helped and taught me.
Done it for lots of other people, too, of course,” she
hastened to add. “I’d never once thought of him as a
person I could help.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now—”</p>

<p>“Now—” Her grave look went as far as that of the
blind who seem to descry Truth riding on the viewless
air, or sitting on the round world’s uttermost rim. Certainly
Hildegarde had been given such extension of
vision in these hours that plainly enough she saw that
it was not till a cloud settled on Cheviot’s fame that she
knew how much its fairness meant to her. Acceptance
of that had brought her acquainted with yet another
new aspect of experience. Here was a man that had
everybody and everything to recommend him—<em>up to
yesterday</em>. Since yesterday she knew not only that his
nature and his outlook were on one side defective, she
had glimpses of a faith that, precisely because of this,
he had a need of her beyond the one he had been used to
urge. A light shone in the thought that there was something
she could do for him that perhaps no other creature
could. A perception this of infinite significance to
such as Hildegarde Mar, belonging as she did to the
bigger of the two camps into which womankind are
naturally divided. For, <i lang="la">pace</i> the satirists, those of her
sex who make most stir in the world and cause most
commotion in the hearts of men—those daughters of the
horse leech, whose unappeased hunger cries ever “More,
more! Give! and give again!” they are in the minority.
To the larger, if less striking army, those whose primal
passion is to give—of them was Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“It looks as if—for all Louis is so wonderfully clear-headed
and I’m so—the other way, there are some things
I can see plainer than he. But it seems to me that’s
only a reason for”—her voice dropped a little—“for—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Locke.</p>

<p>Hildegarde flushed faintly. “For trying, I don’t
mean by preaching, but trying to help him to see—well,
some of the things you’ve given me an inkling of.”
She laid her hand gently on the older woman’s. Mrs.
Locke’s fingers closed round the girl’s, but she said
nothing. “So, though he nearly broke your arm, you
will have done him a service.”</p>

<p>The white face smiled its enigmatic little smile. But
presently, “I’m glad I know you,” she said.</p>

<p>“Are you? Then let’s be friends!”</p>

<p>As though some tangible barrier had been beaten
down they went nearer the two men. The captain was
ending, “—and if the ice closes in behind us we’ll be
trapped.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that all!” said Cheviot, glancing toward Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t all. We’d be carried wherever the floe
goes—and that’s not Nome.” Gillies lowered the glass,
and his strained-looking eyes fell on the two he had forgotten.
“Sorry, ladies, you must go below.”</p>

<p>Not only rather snubbed, but feeling now the gravity
of affairs, Hildegarde and her companion departed with
some precipitation, while the captain’s hoarse shout
rang out in an indistinguishable order to some invisible
officer.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, standing on bales of merchandise
for’ard on the upper deck, they watched the altering of
the course and the race for that single opening, narrow
and ever narrower in the close-packed ice. It was exciting
enough, for they got out just in time. Thirty-four
hours afterward the <i>Los Angeles</i> was still beating about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
on the edge of the pack, looking for another break in the
long white line.</p>

<p>The spirits of the passengers steadily sank. To their
jealous imagining all those phantom ships, and the score
unseen, were now forging ahead. Only the <i>Los Angeles</i>
besieged the ice in vain. Men stood in knots discussing
the captain’s mistakes and airing their own knowledge.
They had expected this state of things if he persisted in
keeping so far to the east. Hour by hour Gillies’s credit
fell.</p>

<p>The only break in the dead monotony of the afternoon
was suggested in the general invitation to come
for’ard and hear Gedge roast the captain. It went ill
that day with any witness in Gillies’s favor.</p>

<p>In the middle of dinner people looked up from their
plates and said: “What’s that?”</p>

<p>The bean-feaster was the first to find his tongue.
“By ——,” he said, “we’ve stopped!” The passengers
dropped their knives and forks and rushed on deck.
The bean-feaster was right. In trying to get round the
eastern shoulder of the floe, the <i>Los Angeles</i> had run
aground in Norton Sound, thirty miles from the mainland.
The engines were reversed, and the water round
the propeller was set boiling. The ship never budged.
The deck resounded to the uproar of many tongues.
To waste thirty-six hours feeling her way round the
floe was bad enough, but to be “hung up on a sand-bar,”
a hundred and fifty miles from Nome, with a wicked-looking
ice-pack bearing down on you from the west—!
And here comes the <i>Charles Nelson</i> once more, very
perky this time, profiting by the object lesson and steering
clear of the bar. The <i>Los Angeles</i> humbled her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
pride to ask for a line. “Can’t get near enough,” the
word came back. “I’m in three fathom now!” and
away <i>Charles Nelson</i> goes, leaving the big steamer to
her fate.</p>

<p>“What’s that feller calls himself a captain, what’s
he goin’ to <em>do</em>?” demanded Mr. Gedge of his satellites.
“‘Wait for the tide!’ Yah! He’s got the most high-spirited
idears of any man I ever—‘Wait!’ After
wastin’ two days and nights a’ready! ‘Wait!’ While
the other fellers are knockin’ the bottom out o’
Nome!”</p>

<p>This was a harassing thought, but the captain still
had his apologists, even in the Kangaroo Court. It was
O’Gorman’s friend with the fiery beard who dared to
point out, “Mr. Gedge told us on Friday and Saturday
the captain was ‘incompetent and foolhardy.’ On Sunday
and Monday he’s ‘over-cautious and damnably
slow.’ To-night Mr. Gedge tells us—”</p>

<p>“To-night,” that gentleman shouted, “I’m tellin’
you still more about this —— captain. Did they or did
they not say to us in Seattle that Gillies was a first-rate
seaman?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and so he is!”</p>

<p>“Did they or did they not tell us he knew his job?”</p>

<p>“Right! Knows this ship as you know the way to
your mouth.”</p>

<p>“Yah! Knows what she can do on the Japan route.
But this, gentlemen and ladies, ain’t the road to Manila.
And do you know what? This here is Captain Gillies’s
first trip to Alaska!” Gedge brought it out with a
sledge-hammer effect. The audience felt they were expected
to be dumfounded. They complied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>But a voice was heard: “It’s most people’s first trip
to Alaska.”</p>

<p>“I tell you,” said Gedge, judicially, “he knows as
little about these northern seas as that boy there with
the banjer.”</p>

<p>“This self-appointed judge,” Cheviot’s voice rose
steadily above the growing murmur, “hasn’t heard apparently
that <em>nobody</em> knows these waters.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind repeatin’ that, sir?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. In the first place, the Bering is a practically
uncharted sea. That may be a disgrace to our
Coast Survey, but it’s hardly the captain’s fault.”</p>

<p>Gedge looked stumped for a moment. If this were
true it wouldn’t do for him not to know it.</p>

<p>Cheviot was making good the diversion in the captain’s
favor, when Gedge interrupted: “Does the captain’s
friend pretend to say that the whalers and sealers
and fellers who’ve been up here before gold was
thought of—that none o’ <em>them</em> don’t know enough to
keep off a damned sand-bank?” Looking his wiliest:
“Now, if we had one o’ them sort here—” Then, with
a highly effective coup: “Ladies and gentlemen, we got
him!”</p>

<p>“Here on this ship?”</p>

<p>“Right here on board the <i>Los Angeles</i>!”</p>

<p>“Where? Who, who? Name?” Everybody but
Cheviot and a few women were shouting themselves
hoarse.</p>

<p>“What y’ got to say to that, Mr.— You, there,
with the arctic cap and the tender heart fur captains?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got this to say. That even the men who sailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
along here last fall, don’t know Norton Sound this summer.”</p>

<p>“<em>Wot?</em>”</p>

<p>“Can’t know it.”</p>

<p>“And why not?”</p>

<p>“For the good reason that new sand-bars are formed
up here every spring. Not a ship that sails for any port
on the northwest coast but goes on what’s practically an
exploring expedition. That’s our true danger. The
captain’s no less than ours.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we all know you’re in with his nibs, but
what my friends don’t know is that Billings &amp; Co. sent a
pilot aboard this ship.”</p>

<p>“Why, then,” roared half-a-dozen voices, “why ain’t
he pilotin’!”</p>

<p>“Why?” Mr. Gedge shouted above the din. “<em>I</em> can
tell—” His sentence was jerked to an abrupt close.
“What in hell’s up?”</p>

<p>Two or three women had uttered little shrieks, and,
“What was that?” people asked one another. Men
turned and looked in each other’s faces. “What <em>was</em>
it?”</p>

<p>The sudden jar and vibration of the ship lent added
force to Mr. Gedge’s charge. “The reason the pilot
ain’t pilotin’ is because the captain ordered him off the
bridge the second day out.”</p>

<p>“Now I know what it means when the papers say,
‘Sensation in the court’!” a little Canadian hospital
nurse whispered to Mrs. Locke. But in another second
she was clinging to that lady and her eyes were scared
and wide; for, as if under the assault of a battering-ram,
the <i>Los Angeles</i> was shaking from stem to stern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>Hildegarde felt a warm hand laid on her two, tight-clasped
and cold. Cheviot had put an arm through the
outer fringe of the group where she and Mrs. Locke
were standing. “Come for’ard,” he said.</p>

<p>“Was that the ice?” Mrs. Locke whispered, allowing
herself to be drawn along.</p>

<p>All the rest of the people stood hushed for a moment
as if stunned by the concussion. The three who alone in
those first instants seemed to retain power of movement
quietly made their way out of the throng, while every
ear was filled with the horrible secondary sounds of that
mighty impact—a slow grinding, a horrible gritting, as
of granite jaws reducing the bones of prey to powder.</p>

<p>“I want you to stay here till I come back.” Cheviot
left the two women under the bridge. As Hildegarde
listened with beating heart to the sound of the ice
against the ship, she said to herself: “These are moments
Jack Galbraith has known. After to-night I shall
understand better. I shall be closer to a part of his life
than Bella ever will.” Every sense was set to note the
change that in the last few minutes had come over the
spirit of the ship. No wild commotion, a hush rather.
But a thing of eery significance. No more shrill harangues
in the Kangaroo Court. No dancing on the upper
deck. No <em>tink-a-tink</em> of banjo in the steerage. Men
gathering in groups, talking for the most part quite
quietly, but agreed that “the old sea tramp” wouldn’t
stand much of this kind of thing. With a single mind
the women, as soon as they had pulled themselves together,
hastened down below.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go down, too, and see—” Hildegarde began.
“I won’t be two minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“To the cabin. Do you want anything brought
up?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The girl was longer than two minutes, but she was no
less surprised when, upon her reappearance with a small
hand-bag, she found Cheviot talking to Mrs. Locke.
“The current is carrying the ice out all right. Probably
the only danger is the passengers making fools of themselves.
But if they’ll only go quietly to bed—”</p>

<p>“They won’t,” said Mrs. Locke. The two discussed
this quite in the tone of being allies. “Nobody will go
to bed to-night,” she assured him.</p>

<p>“What do they want to do?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Sit up till one in the morning,” Mrs. Locke answered,
“and see the tide float us off the bar.”</p>

<p>“Well, the women at all events”—Cheviot looked
about with an air of relief—“the women have gone to
bed already.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Hildegarde. “They’re tumbling
over one another down in the saloon, in and out of the
state-rooms collecting their things. Some are saying
their prayers, and some—”</p>

<p>“Do you sing?” Cheviot demanded.</p>

<p>“I?” Mrs. Locke stared. “No.”</p>

<p>“Who does?” he appealed to Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard a woman yesterday—”</p>

<p>“Oh, that awful Miss Pinckney, you know, with the
draggled feathers!”</p>

<p>“Well, go and find her and get her to sing now.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sing?</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sing. It may make just all the difference.”
Cheviot was in the act of bolting back to the captain.</p>

<p>“She can’t sing.” Hildegarde followed him a step.</p>

<p>He misunderstood it for an untimely musical criticism.
“Then let her make a noise of some sort.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s doing that—screaming with hysterics
down in the saloon.” Cheviot flashed back to say confidentially,
not to Hildegarde, but to Mrs. Locke: “Go
and see if you can’t get up a concert.” With which cool
and apparently crazy suggestion he vanished.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later a woman, wearing diamond ear-rings
and a sealskin jacket, paused in her flight up the
companionway and leaned an instant, panting, against
the music-room door. Now she was lifting her head with
a slow incredulity, as an unsteady voice near by began
to quaver out a rag-time ballad, highly offensive to sensitive
ears, but a tune familiar and to many on the ship
most dear. The woman peered round the half-open door,
staring from one to the other of those callous creatures
within, making merry on the brink of destruction—Miss
Mar at the piano, and at her side the draggled
Miss Pinckney. Ah, no, that red-eyed woman wasn’t
callous. She sang the inane words with lips that trembled.
Now she was breaking down.</p>

<p>“No, no. Go on,” Miss Mar insisted. “Think of the
others.”</p>

<p>“They’ll never listen. Everybody’s too—too—”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s see. Now!” and very ineffectually Hildegarde
took up the second verse. Miss Pinckney
plucked the strain away as two men looked in. There
was nothing especial to take them up or down. They
stood near the woman with the diamond ear-rings, hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
knowing that they listened. In that first twenty minutes,
every time the ice struck the ship, Miss Pinckney would
hesitate and her voice would fly off the scale in a faint
scream.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>please</em>! That’s enough to scare anybody!” and
Hildegarde played doggedly on. “Now, let’s try
again!” It was, however, as if not Miss Mar’s admonishing,
but the rude insistence of the tune dragged Miss
Pinckney along, pulling her out of the pit of her fears
and landing her “Down along the Bowery,” or “In Gay
Paree,” or some place equally remote from the sand-bar
in the Bering Sea.</p>

<p>Mrs. Locke, with the Blumpittys and a brace of doctors
in tow, appeared in the act of descending for a
muster of “the company.” Cheviot came flying down
behind them, two steps at a time. He was about to turn
in at the music-room, when a woman pushed past him,
showing a panic-stricken face above the sleeping child
that she carried clutched tight against her breast. A
sudden jar made the sleeper lift a cropped head and
look about with wide eyes.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Cheviot reassuringly, in a cheerful and
commonplace voice. “This is a passenger I haven’t
seen before. Aren’t you rather too big, sir, to be carried?”</p>

<p>—“hasn’t been well!” muttered the woman, taking
breath to recommence the ascent.</p>

<p>“Look here, where are you going?” And without
waiting to know, “Some of us can carry—” He was
taking the burden out of the thin arms.</p>

<p>“No,” remonstrated the woman, as Cheviot turned in
at the music-room, “we must go up to father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll send him down to you.”</p>

<p>“No, no. We’ve got to go up and—be ready.”</p>

<p>“Ready for what?” He fixed upon the woman a pair
of faith-inspiring eyes so unclouded that she stared.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to listen to the singing?” Cheviot
bent smiling to the little person who lay quite content in
his arms, studying the man’s face with the solemn absorption
of childhood.</p>

<p>Not many there besides him, but because Cheviot had
come in the concert had begun. Others besides Hildegarde
felt this quickening of life in any room he entered.
Miss Pinckney remembered she had the music of a “reel
pretty song” out of the “Belle of New York.” She’d
go and get it.</p>

<p>“Do you hear that?” Cheviot said, depositing the
child on one of the rickety chairs. “You’ve just come
in time,” and he stood a moment talking to the mother.
The child sat askew, with its father’s great waterproof
cape hitched up on one side and trailing on the other.
When the little figure made the slightest movement the
lop-sided chair wobbled and threatened collapse. Instantly
the child desisted and became nervously engrossed
in the problem of a nice equilibrium. The little
face took on a look of tense uneasiness. It was plain
that courage was lacking so much as to pull a good deep
breath lest it draw ruin down. Cheviot, still talking
with the mother, turned to take in his the small child
hand that clutched the chair. Was it the look of heavy
responsibility in the small face, or was it another onslaught
of ice against the ship that made him say,
“Music’s soon going to begin, little—what’s your
name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>The child opened thin lips and emitted a careful
sound.</p>

<p>“Joseph? Well, I hope you’ll like the concert,
Joseph.” That was too much for the occupant of the
<i lang="fr">siege perilous</i>. There was a howl above the mother’s
reproachful correction. “Her name’s Josephine,”—a
general giving way to overstrain, and chair and child
were in ruins on the floor.</p>

<p>Miss Mar, glancing over her shoulder, shaking with
hysterical laughter, saw that Louis, gathering up the
sobbing Josephine, bit his lip as though in mere dismay,
forbearing to wound the luckless one by laughing at
her discomfiture.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s like him, too,” Hildegarde said to herself,
as one welcoming one more of a cloud of witnesses.
She fell upon the piano with redoubled vigor. Loud and
fast she hammered out the wildest jig she could remember.
Miss Pinckney coming back, music in hand, stopped
with a scream. Bang! Bang! Grit! Grind! went the ice.
Josephine shrieked without intermission till Cheviot,
having found a chair with more than three legs, anchored
her securely in that haven. With the first words of Miss
Pinckney’s song, Cheviot was flying back to the deck.</p>

<p>Bang! Grit! Grind! Was she awake, Hildegarde
asked herself, or was this fetid room and were these
harsh, assailing sounds a form of nightmare? Steadily
she played on. Cheviot looked in again, but it was to
Mrs. Locke he whispered: “We must break up the
Kangaroo Court. Musical talent going to waste there.”
She followed him out. In passing Hildegarde he had
bent his head. “Keep it up,” he said. “Whatever you
do, don’t stop.” She reflected a little enviously that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
she could be quite as happy running about the deck with
Louis as pinned to the moth-eaten music-stool, grinding
out cheap airs. Then she found herself smiling. Not
the least strange part of this strange evening that Louis
should be sending Mrs. Locke on errands, and that Mrs.
Locke should be going. The room was filling. Upon
the lady’s reappearance with the banjo boy and the
cross-eyed flute-player, the concert was in full swing. Now
Mrs. Locke was telling Hildegarde to play the “Battle
Hymn,” and presently several of the men were helping
Miss Pinckney to send John Brown’s soul marching on.
Oh, for a little air! Surely there wasn’t room for any
more people in this overcrowded space. But still they
came. It was curious to watch the new faces at the door
peering over the shoulders of those who stood about the
piano. Little by little you could see the strain going
out of the tense features. Not that their anxieties vanished,
but they were softened, humanized through the
humble agency of a ramshackle piano and an untrained
voice in a song. Even the steps, from the very top to
the bottom of the companionway, were crowded now.
That fact of itself made for quiescence on the decks.
People could no longer run freely up or down. While
they paused and wormed their way, they were laid hold
of by their ears. The little room was packed to suffocation.
Deserted by his audience, even Gedge came down
to see what was up. Thicker and more stifling grew the
air. In a pause between songs a scrap of conversation
floated over Hildegarde’s shoulder, “Lucky there’s no
wind.”</p>

<p>“God, yes! If there was wind—”</p>

<p>“Shut up!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>“What then, if there was wind—?” a third insisted,
barely audible.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>then</em>, we’d get off the bar.” Clear enough to
one of those for whose weaker sake the truth was veiled—clear
enough what the ironic comfort meant. If behind
the ice were wind as well as current, the ship
wouldn’t live an hour. Steadily the girl played on.
Wasn’t the onslaught of the ice heavier that last time?
Was the wind rising then? Yes, surely, surely, the wind
had risen. Well, one must play the louder. But her
tranced eyes turned now right, now left. Some faces
clearer than others in the haze. Gedge, with his pasty
visage bleached to chalk, and of his cheap but heady
eloquence never a word. Others here that Hildegarde
had seen night after night, gambling, drinking, quarreling—and
now ...!</p>

<p>These rude fellow-creatures, little admirable as they
might show themselves in happier hours, wore something
very like dignity to-night. How still they were!
It did not escape Hildegarde that all these many pairs of
eyes were either lowered or fixed on space, as if each one
forebore to read in his fellow’s face confirmation of his
own grim knowledge. Each avoiding the other’s eyes,
they stood there listening to those sounds the puny piano
was ineffectual to drown—the crash of impact and the
yet more horrible crunching, vicious and prolonged, as
though man’s arch-enemy of the deep, after battering
vainly for admission, would gnaw his admission to this
strange concert on the ice-beleaguered bar. While the
nerves of the people still vibrated under the bombardment,
some one started “Nearer, my God, to Thee.”
Strangest of all on that strange evening was the revelation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
that in this particular company hardly one but
seemed to know the hymn, and few that were not singing
it with abandon to the thunderous bass of the ice. Whatever
your own thoughts might be, you read in more than
one of these faces that of a certainty God was “nearer”
this night than He had often been before. At the beginning
of the last verse, the loudest crash of all, as if a
hundred tons of iron had been hurled at the <i>Los Angeles</i>.
The people, led by one unfaltering voice, kept on
singing. Only Hildegarde’s flying fingers stumbled as
the ship shrank and cowered under the blow. Had it
ended like this for Galbraith, too? Would he and she
meet down there in the kind sea caves?</p>

<p>Cheviot’s face looked in through the haze. Of course
she had known he would come for her at the last. When
those firm lips opened she would hear him saying: “Stop
your playing. We’ve done what we could—you down
here, I on deck. Let us go now and meet the end.” Oh, it
was well that he was here! Through the haze his face
swam nearer, and what he was really saying was: “Good
girl! If only you can keep it up a little longer!” And
with that the face grew dim.</p>

<p>“A little longer!” Faintness, like sleep, stole over
the good girl. As a peculiar throbbing went through the
ship, Hildegarde felt the hulk of the <i>Los Angeles</i> open,
and knew vaguely that she was falling.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;" id="illus8">
<img src="images/illus8.jpg" width="450" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“Nearer, my God, to Thee”</p>
</div>

<p>When she opened her eyes Louis was lifting her up.
She was not clinging to a berg, nor even sitting on a
cake of ice. Still in the noisome little room, and still
that throbbing was shaking the ship. The people who
had been so quiet were pushing, jostling, shouting, frantic
to get— Where? To the boats, of course! All except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
Louis and Mrs. Locke. Noble souls, they were
ready to stay and die with Hildegarde Mar! She must
exert herself.</p>

<p>“Now I can go.”</p>

<p>“There’s no hurry,” says Cheviot.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, come. We must try—we, too.”</p>

<p>“Try what?”</p>

<p>“Why, to—to save ourselves.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Poor girl, do you feel dreadfully shipwrecked?”</p>

<p>“What, then, are they all running for?” She looked
round bewildered.</p>

<p>“The engines have started. Tide’s nearly flood. Can
you walk? That’s right.” They helped her to the
deck. Long after midnight—and the world so bright!
Oh, the blessing of the pure, cold air! While she
breathed it in, O’Gorman stopped to whisper in Cheviot’s
ear: “By George, you’ve saved a panic!”</p>

<p>“No,” says Cheviot, “it wasn’t my concert.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">In those last hours the great body of the floe
had swung away to westward. It was
the very rear-guard of the outgoing ice that
had assisted at the concert. By this unfailing
daylight you could see, an hour after
midnight, the shining stretch of smooth water that lay
between the <i>Los Angeles</i> and the invisible mainland.
People hung over the ship’s side to watch the flood-tide
swirl and churn under the propeller, while the “old
sea tramp,” mustering every pound of energy, struggled
to get free. Yes, it was exciting enough, but to the tall
girl bending her hatless head over the railing at Cheviot’s
side, not half as exciting as certain discoveries
she was making without the aid of steam. Not alone in
Norton Sound was the tide at flood. She drew closer to
her companion with a mingled joy and shyness. Just
that little nearer drawing, how strange that it should
be the stuff of which so great happiness is made! Was
he feeling it, too? Was he realizing? Or was all his
soul down there in the turgid water foaming under the
propeller’s beat. She remembered enviously how Louis’s
little nephew would pat you on the arm if you grew
abstracted, and remind you: “I’m here.” She longed
to do the same. She even did it in a less direct fashion
with the words: “I should think, by the feel of the air,
there must be more icebergs on their way down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hard work,” he said, all his sympathies with the
propeller.</p>

<p>“Brrr!” remarked Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“Nearly as much mud as water,” he went on, with
equal irrelevance.</p>

<p>“It certainly <em>is</em> a great deal colder,” she persisted, as
though he had denied that fact.</p>

<p>“Less than two fathoms at low tide—”</p>

<p>“Brrr! Brrr!”</p>

<p>Ah, that had brought him back. From the overcoat
he was wearing he hurriedly unbuttoned the tweed cape,
and when he got it off put it round Hildegarde’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you won’t miss it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It won’t keep you warm if it isn’t buttoned.” With
a droll preoccupied air and a pursed lip, less like a lover
paying graceful attentions to his lady than like a clumsy
nurse with a small child to look after, Cheviot laboriously
buttoned up the cape. Only, a nurse, however
little skilled, would not have begun at the bottom, nor,
having at last buttoned her way to the top, would she
have so nearly buttoned in her charge’s chin. Hildegarde
laughed, and considering she’d been so short a
time in the cape, grew miraculously warm. To avoid
looking at Cheviot she looked down to see how the propeller
might be getting on.</p>

<p>“You must be still just half a minute, you know,” he
admonished her, and they found themselves laughing
into each other’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I ought to go and get my own things,” she said.
“Brrr!”</p>

<p>He took off his arctic cap and dropped it on the
blonde head. “<em>Now</em> will you be good!” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>They seemed to be the only people on the <i>Los Angeles</i>
to know a moment’s intermission in the stark suspense
of hanging over the ship’s side waiting for the blessed
moment that should see them, by aid of flood and steam,
floated off the bar.</p>

<p>At last! the throbbing modified by a new motion.
Slowly the ship swayed fore and aft with a faint see-sawing
effect. A great cheer, “She’s off!” was cut short
by the excitement of watching how the boast was being
made good. Ten seconds’ breathless waiting for that
final pull out of the mud-trap, while idle muscles grew
taut as though to help the ship in her labor, and then
slowly, unwillingly, relaxed. Despair fell upon the
crowd as the <i>Los Angeles</i> grounded again more firmly
than before. In vain her engines pulled and throbbed,
breathing into the delicate dawn-flushed air inky bursts
of smoke.</p>

<p>Some one called out, “She’s canted to starboard,”
and another described the dilemma as “a righteous
judgment for the overloading.”</p>

<p>“If we’re stuck here because there’s so many of us
aboard, we can get off for the same reason.” Gedge’s
“brilliant idear” was that the people should be massed
for’ard, and then, upon a signal, should tear as hard as
legs could carry them to the other end of the ship. The
sudden shifting of “ballast” would work the keel free.
The game was entered into with immense spirit. Any
one who, from a balloon, could have looked down on the
scampering horde would have taken the scene for one of
frenetic lunacy. Whether by such an effect as Gedge
anticipated, or by some other agency, just once the tall
mast swayed like some strong-rooted pine in a passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
breeze. The people shrieked with triumph, and tore
madly back again from stem to stern. But they and the
engines and the foaming water might rage as they would.
“The keel’s grown fast to the bottom of the ocean,”
Hildegarde whispered.</p>

<p>Louis turned and looked into the face that was so
close to his own. “Never mind—” he began.</p>

<p>“I am never-minding.” She smiled back into his
grave eyes.</p>

<p>But he seemed to feel that, nevertheless, she must need
reassuring. “We’ll get off all right <em>somehow</em>.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow?” she asked, quite without eagerness.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about to-morrow.” He looked past his
companion at harassed, disappointed faces. “It’s a
plain case for a little patience.”</p>

<p>“Do I strike you as impatient?”</p>

<p>“You strike me as—” He seemed to pull himself
up, and yet he allowed himself to say it slowly: “You
were splendid to-night.”</p>

<p>She glowed inwardly. “Louis!”</p>

<p>“Yes.” They were leaning far over the railing again,
shoulder to shoulder.</p>

<p>“Louis.”</p>

<p>“Well. You got that far before. What comes next?”</p>

<p>“I let you say all that about my not needing you.
But if you knew how I’ve been blessing you for—for
your forbearance with my stubbornness about coming—for
your forgiveness—”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk nonsense.”</p>

<p>“You are far too good—to <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p>He seemed not to feel the prick of any point in her
emphasis. “I can’t have you talking of goodness as between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
you and me—it’s foolishness,” he said lightly.
Then as she opened her lips, “I forbid you even to think
of it.”</p>

<p>“I think of nothing else,” she answered gently.</p>

<p>Instead of giving her proper credit for that, Louis
sent a wandering eye over his shoulder. Actually, he
was making an excuse of listening to that blatant Gedge
bellowing about the “damnable delay.”</p>

<p>She looked at Cheviot with a frank perplexity that
before she knew it had gone over into longing. Is he going
to decline to make the least little bit of love to me
because I’m away from home? Is that the “sort o’
watchman” he’s going to be? Oh, <em>dear</em>!</p>

<p>“Do you know what time it is?” The watchman
pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>“I don’t care the very least in the world what time
it is.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what always happens when the sun
shines all night. It’s very demoralizing.”</p>

<p>Demoralizing! That after all those hours of strain in
the foul atmosphere below, that she should be willing
to stand here awhile in the crisp and radiant morning
talking to him; talking more gratefully than ever she
had done in her life—“demoralizing!” He wasn’t
even now attending to her. “Why do you allow Gedge
to bother you so? It isn’t like you,” she said. Still
he wore that tantalizing air of listening to the orator on
the rope coil. “What difference can it make to you anything
a man like that may say?”</p>

<p>“It might make a difference to more than me—if he
wasn’t looked after. I believe I’ll go and do it. Good-night,
Good Girl!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>The couple of hours of chill sunshine after breakfast
showed a waveless sea. Far off against the eastern horizon
were single icebergs, that looked like the white tents
pitched on the glassy surface of the sound.</p>

<p>To the passengers on the grounded ship the calm
weather was only a goad to rage. The rest of the Nome
fleet—<em>they</em> were profiting by open water and absence of
head winds! But as for us of the <i>Los Angeles</i>, we’ve
left our families, sold our farms, risked all we have on
earth for the pleasure of sitting on a sand-bank a hundred
and fifty miles from the gold-fields!</p>

<p>From hour to hour the disaffection spread. Every
one on board had a remedy for the disaster. Where it
had been thought were miners, attorneys, doctors, politicians,
it turned out they were navigators to a man.</p>

<p>No glimpse of Cheviot till an hour after breakfast.
Even then only a nod and “Good-morning,” as he went
by deep in talk with the chief engineer. Toward ten
o’clock a little wind sprang out of the northeast and
brought down a thin veil of fog. The air took on a
keener edge, yet no one left the deck or even seemed to
feel the cold, for a rumor had run about the ship like
fire over dry stubble: “The captain says we’ll never
get off this —— bar till we unload.”</p>

<p>“Unload! Unload what?”</p>

<p>Pat the answer: “First, the coal.”</p>

<p>“Throw away <em>coal</em>!”</p>

<p>Such a counsel of despair struck grave enough on the
ears of men who knew the fabulous sums paid in Nome
for fuel. But not the coal, it was the little word “first”
that presented the keenest barb to each man’s consciousness.
Just as though the immense sacrifice of the coal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
were not fit and sufficient climax to the misadventure!
“First!” What possible second? Why, after the coal,
overboard with McKeown and Dingley and the rest of
the heavy stuff!</p>

<p>“Just let the Cap’n lay a finger on my Dingley,”
warned a bystander, black as thunder.</p>

<p>“That’s what he’s figurin’ on,” Gedge assured the
irate one. “And after the machinery”—people crowded
aghast to hear—“if we ain’t light enough by then, why,
overboard with every darn thing we got!”</p>

<p>“If he tries throwin’ out our stuff he’ll have a riot
on his hands—that’s all!”</p>

<p>Things began to look black for the captain.</p>

<p>But if he were aware of the fact, it had no effect on
his policy. Hardly ten minutes later Gedge was obliged
to interrupt the indignation meeting by calling out to a
couple of blue China boys, struggling to get some of the
lighter baggage out of the hold: “Hi, you! Stop that,
you pig-tailed heathen. That’s mine. Drop it, I say,
or I’ll knock the stuffin’ out o’ you!”</p>

<p>The agitated Celestials would have abandoned their
task, but for O’Gorman’s: “Say! They’re only getting
your stuff up into a safe place so they can reach the coal-bunkers.
Here, put the gentleman’s box over by mine.”</p>

<p>In a couple of hours the deck was piled high with
miscellaneous baggage, and a derrick, hurriedly rigged,
was hauling up the heavier things out of the bowels of
the ship. As they came swinging out of the darkness
into the chill gray light, people recognized their belongings
with an anxiety hardly allayed by the temporary
stowage of their all upon the deck—too palpably a possible
half-way station to the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>Gedge’s following was now so great as to be unwieldy.
They blocked the narrow gangway, they settled like flies
on the freight. He drew off a chosen few, and retired
out of the bitter wind to the shelter of the smoke-stack
to hold a private session.</p>

<p>“If that fellow had some education,” said Governor
Reinhart, “he’d be helping to guide the ship of state
at Washington.”</p>

<p>“He seems likely to guide this ship into trouble
enough,” Cheviot answered crisply.</p>

<p>“What is he doing now?” Hildegarde asked.</p>

<p>“He’s—” Reinhart began and hesitated.</p>

<p>Under his breath O’Gorman finished the sentence.
“Trying to incite a lot of fools to mutiny.”</p>

<p>“What does he want them to do?”</p>

<p>“Put the captain in irons.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“And turn the ship over to the pilot and first officer—that
fellow coming off the bridge now.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde followed Louis’s eyes and saw they were
fixed not on the dapper officer descending, but were on
the square figure of the captain standing motionless on
the bridge, looking down at the coolies busy as ants
about the hold. But he looked, not as if he saw them.
The hard face was red and angry. Hildegarde, with
her genius for sympathy, divined something in it infinitely
miserable, too. “How lonely the man looks,”
she said aside to Cheviot.</p>

<p>“You can’t be at the head of things and not be
lonely.”</p>

<p>The words deepened her sense of commiseration.
“You don’t think he knows about Gedge’s wild talk?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, probably.”</p>

<p>“I wish he could be reminded he has friends among
us as well as enemies.”</p>

<p>“I was just going up,” Louis said.</p>

<p>“Do you think I might come? Just for a moment?”</p>

<p>“Well, if he fires you out you aren’t to complain.”</p>

<p>“Complain? No. But I shall still believe it’s a pity
that men think whoever is to know the truth about a
danger or a difficulty, it mustn’t be a woman. Don’t
you see it would be a gain to both sides that we should
know?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. It would scare most women and bore
the rest. Besides, they’d be in the way.”</p>

<p>“If that’s so it’s only because they’ve been kept so
ignorant. Louis”—the voice dropped softly—“do you
know what I’ve been thinking about often and often?”</p>

<p>He waited a moment before he said: “Since we got
into the ice?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I do.” But he said it so stonily she
stopped half-way up the companionway and looked back
at him. “I’ve been thinking I should never have known
you if I hadn’t come on this journey.”</p>

<p>“Oh, found me out, have you?”</p>

<p>Hearing Cheviot’s short laugh, Gillies jerked his head
angrily over his shoulder. Hildegarde hesitated at the
top of the companionway. “It looks like a dreadful
breach of discipline,” she said, “but it isn’t. You told
me I might come again.”</p>

<p>“In here, then,” said Gillies gruffly, and took them to
his room. He was shaking like one in an ague, but he
seemed not so ill pleased to see some one from the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
below. He gave the girl a chair. “It’s all right,” he
said. “Only it’s no good for others to see you up
here.” He fell into the remaining seat with a heavy
thud, and his bullet head hung forward. “Well?” he
demanded, with a forced laugh, turning bloodshot eyes
on Cheviot. Hildegarde saw plainer now what an unnatural
color Gillies was. Did the shivering and the
purple and scarlet stains mean a sickening for fever, or
only a horrible anxiety and an all-night watch in the
cold?</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you didn’t get much sleep,” she began.</p>

<p>“Not for two nights now,” he said, and then looking
at Cheviot: “This’ll be all over the coast, from Nome to
’Frisco.” As he spoke the hard face twitched.</p>

<p>“What will?” Cheviot answered. “That the floods
have made a new bar in Norton Sound this spring?”</p>

<p>The captain uttered an inarticulate sound, something
between a grunt and a groan. “First trip, too! Ship
full of damned newspaper people. Land rats, starving
for a story.” He choked, and stood up stamping his
cold feet, and while he did so, through the port he forced
the sleep-defrauded eyes to reconnoiter the sharp, white
outline of the distant icebergs.</p>

<p>“There are people on board who’ll get the story
right,” said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t care! Let ’em say what they like—if
only the wind doesn’t bring the floe down on us again.”
Cheviot made a move as if to go. “The trouble is,”
said Gillies, “I’m short of hands. However hard they
keep at it those China boys can’t shift five hundred tons
of coal before the tide’s flood.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got a lot of white men on board—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” growled the captain, “and a lot of help I’ll
get out of them.”</p>

<p>“What I came up for”—Cheviot drew nearer—“was
really to tell you there are men on board this ship who
propose to stand by you.”</p>

<p>Gillies, leaning against the locker, neither said nor
looked a syllable of thanks. Never even took his bloodshot
eyes off the ice line. But the hard face twitched
again. A sense of the devouring anxiety he was obviously
laboring under made the girl quick to relieve him of any
added strain or restraint that he might feel in an unfamiliar
presence at such a crisis. Even Louis might be
thinking “a woman was in the way.” She stood up,
murmuring an excuse for going.</p>

<p>The captain, unheeding, went on in that hoarse, muffled
voice: “I’ve just sent an officer below to see if I can
get some volunteers.”</p>

<p>“What officer?” said Cheviot. “Not the first?”</p>

<p>“Why not? Yes, the first.” And there was a silence
so significant that Hildegarde was glad she had not
waited for that to tell her she should leave the men to
themselves. But at the threshold she had to stand back
an instant to let the cabin-boy pass. As he was in the
act of darting in with some food, the wind whisked a
paper napkin off the tray. He stooped in the doorway,
clutched after the elusive object with skinny, yellow
fingers, and as he did so the soup slid off the tray and
cascaded over the threshold.</p>

<p>The captain swore, and the China boy gabbled as he
mopped wildly with the ineffectual paper napkin. “God
forgive me if ever I go to sea again with a lot of damned
Chinamen. I’d have tried kedging before this, if I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
a crew that could understand anything but routine
orders. As it is I’ll be lucky if I get the coal out in
time.”</p>

<p>“I can’t promise you sailors, but say the word, and
I’ll get you some sort of volunteers. How many?”</p>

<p>“Well, just to get the coal overboard we’ll need two
or three shifts. And if I have to kedge, after all—it’s
no fun!—but with eight <em>good men</em> I could do it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll undertake to get you the best twenty on the
ship, and you can hold a dozen in reserve.”</p>

<p>As the girl, at last able to get out dryshod, was going
down the companionway, a bird’s-eye view of the upper
deck gave fresh meaning to the scrap of conversation she
had just heard. Out of the black square of the hold the
blue-cotton coolies crawled up the ladder with vast burdens
to add to the chaos of trunks, crates, and machinery,
piled already so perilously high about the deck, and leaving
so narrow a gangway for people to crowd through
that the able-bodied swarmed over the obstructions.</p>

<p>There was Mrs. Locke reading in a sheltered nook,
walled in by towering crates, and just the other side, to
leeward of the smoke-stack, Gedge, in close conclave with
his body-guard.</p>

<p>When Hildegarde, with some difficulty, reached Mrs.
Locke, that lady held up her hand for silence, but, behold,
she wasn’t reading at all. As the girl sank quietly
down, Gedge’s voice reached her clear, although it was
lifted with more than common caution. For ten, fifteen,
twenty minutes he must have gone on airing his seditious
notions; when Mrs. Locke, half rising, whispered, “If
there’s nobody else I think I must go round and talk to
those men myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then a sound of some one flying over the crates
on the wings of haste, and Cheviot’s voice: “Gedge, are
you there?”</p>

<p>“You bet I’m here,” was the surly answer. “And
not likely to get away in a hurry, so far’s I see.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s in our own hands.”</p>

<p>“Just what I’ve been tellin’ the boys.” But there
was a challenge in the voice.</p>

<p>“Your head’s level,” said Cheviot.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re gettin’ tired, too! Comin’ round, are
you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve had about enough of this sitting on the bar, if
that’s what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t we <em>do</em> something?”</p>

<p>“Just what I was going to propose,” said Cheviot
briskly. “Trouble is there aren’t enough hands to get
the coal out before—”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we know that’s his excuse.”</p>

<p>“His? It’s yours and mine. And a pretty lame excuse,
too.”</p>

<p>“Was it you,” demanded Gedge truculently, “that
put it into his empty cocoanut to ask us to lend a hand
at pitchin’ our own stuff overboard?”</p>

<p>“At present it’s a question of pitching out other
fellows’ coal.” Then lower: “See here, Gedge, I want
two words with you.”</p>

<p>“No you don’t. None of us didn’t come up here for
‘words.’ No, nor to try and patch up the captain’s mistakes
by turnin’ ourselves into beasts o’ burden.” Cheviot
lowered his voice and argued a moment or two,
Gedge bursting in with remarks intended to assure his
satellites that he wasn’t being “got at.” But Cheviot
pressed him hard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus9">
<img src="images/illus9.jpg" width="700" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“Coolies crawled up the ladder with vast burdens”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you what we’ll do. If we ain’t goin’
to get out of this fix without we turn to and help that
fool captain—tell you what we’ll do, boys. If we got
to work, we’ll work for Nome wages. Hey, boys? Ten
dollars an hour.”</p>

<p>“Oh, see here!” said Cheviot, “the captain can’t play
up to that lead.”</p>

<p>“Any feller,” shouted Gedge, “that works for a penny
less’n ten dollars an hour is lowerin’ the market. He’s
an enemy to society. He’s a—”</p>

<p>“He’s simply a fellow with a notion he’d like to get
to Nome. I thought you were a pretty sharp customer,
Gedge, but you’re just an every-day sort of ass after
all.” With which Cheviot climbed back over the crates
whistling, as though his momentary concern were at an
end.</p>

<p>“Hello!” O’Gorman called out. Cheviot turned
aside, when he caught sight of the giant towering over
the nook where the two women sat out of the wind.</p>

<p>“What luck?” said O’Gorman, under his breath.</p>

<p>“Four. And you?”</p>

<p>“Only two.” O’Gorman motioned with his head toward
the smoke-stack, and lowered his voice to a whisper:
“He’s got hold of an awful lot of the men.”</p>

<p>Cheviot nodded. “Yes. We’re up against that fellow
everywhere we turn.”</p>

<p>“Always two leaders in every crowd,” O’Gorman
said. “One to lead up, t’other to lead down. I’m
ready to bet on you!”</p>

<p>They talked in undertones. Only Gedge could be
heard distinctly. He was growing hoarse. His increasing
audience was taking on the proportions of a mass
meeting. But the voice of the popular leader was showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
wear. He ended his oration with some abruptness.
“Come along, Joslin. Let’s go and licker up.”</p>

<p>“Now! Nail him now!” whispered Cheviot, and
vaulting over a prodigious pile of machinery he disappeared
with Blumpitty and several others into the hold,
while O’Gorman darted out in the opposite direction
just in time to intercept Gedge and Joslin.</p>

<p>“There’s got to be two shifts. You fellows comin’ to
help?”</p>

<p>“Help!” Gedge rolled out a brace of handsome
oaths. “<em>Help!</em> that—captain?”</p>

<p>“No, help us, help yourselves out of this fix.” Then,
before Gedge could get a word of disclaimer over his
lips: “I hear you are worrying about wages. But this
isn’t a question of money. Lives are at stake. See that
ice over yonder? And look here, I’ve got more on board
this ship than any other one man. Fifteen thousand
dollars is what the freight alone has cost me. But to
save your life”—he took hold of Gedge’s arm—“to save
<em>your</em> life, every ounce of mine may go overboard, and
I’ll help shift it at nothing an hour.”</p>

<p>Gedge looked round rather sheepishly, as if he didn’t
know the answer to this. But suddenly one occurred to
him. “I’m from Missoura,” he said. “You got to
show me. That other feller, too, the one that was givin’
me such a lot of hot air little while ago, why ain’t you
an’ him—”</p>

<p>“You come along with me. I’ll ‘show’ you.”
O’Gorman carried the ringleader and Joslin down into
the hold. Two hours later Hildegarde, peering over the
edge of the square pit, saw among the group engaged in
shoveling coal, Gedge, with the face of a blackamoor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
the sweat pouring down. His surplus energy was at last
being utilized.</p>

<p>Three hundred and fifty tons were flung overboard
before the tide was flood; and again at midnight the
muddy water was set boiling, and the big yellow stack
belched out clouds of smoke. The stranded ship moved a
little, heavily, grudgingly, like a monster half awakened,
and then settled down to finish a second night on the bar.</p>

<p>The captain was not the only man who didn’t sleep.
More than one “sort o’ watchman” showed signs of
strain the next morning. For the fog was thicker than
the day before, the wind veering and no assurance how
far away the ice. It was partly the fever of anxiety
that found vent in sneers, hardly to be called covert,
when it was known the captain meant to take steps to
free the ship that afternoon.</p>

<p>“That glass-eyed idiot don’t even yet know there ain’t
but one tide in this part of the world, and that one’s
near midnight!” was the discarded pilot’s contribution.
That Gillies was prepared for the eccentricities of northern
tides was credited by few.</p>

<p>Open jeers followed his putting off in a small boat,
with the second officer, to sound for deep water.
“What’s the good of deeper water a hundred yards
from the ship?”</p>

<p>The possible good appeared upon the captain’s return.
The anchor that the small boat was to carry back (with
buoys to mark the place selected) looked big enough to
landsmen’s eyes, till they saw the lowering of the one to
be lashed underneath the long boat. This mighty two-and-a-half-ton
iron-grappler, so the rumor ran, was to
be used to “kedge” the steamer off the bar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>But where were the sailors coming from to man a boat
of this size, let alone to carry out successfully so ticklish
an affair?</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” Cheviot had said.</p>

<p>Just how it had been made “right” didn’t appear.
There was no oratory, no public appeal. But three times
as many as the captain wanted were offering to go out
in the fog and plant the great anchor in the choppy sea.</p>

<p>“I—<em>me</em>. You haf bromise I shall go! Not?” A
great muscular German was squeezing his way to Cheviot’s
side.</p>

<p>“All right. No hurry. They’ll be a while yet, getting
those buoys right.”</p>

<p>The general attention was riveted to the second boat
hanging high over the monster anchor that was destined
to be bound lengthwise along the keel. How was any
craft to make her way mounted in so strange a fashion?
How could anybody hope it wouldn’t sink?</p>

<p>“No, the weight will be too well distributed,” Cheviot
had said.</p>

<p>“Yes, till you start layin’ the anchor out yonder,” the
pilot commented darkly.</p>

<p>Hildegarde made a sign to Cheviot. He came to her
across the chain barrier, newly established to keep back
the crowd.</p>

<p>Before the girl could speak, “Those heavy ropes,”
said Mrs. Locke, “that are to lash the big anchor along
the bottom of the boat, how will you ever get them undone
out there in the choppy water?”</p>

<p>“Cut them,” answered Cheviot shortly. “What did
you want, Hildegarde?”</p>

<p>She looked at him appealingly, and then, as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
abandoning some quite different point, “My Blumpitty
is very sore that you are taking the big German instead
of him.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help that.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you want Blumpitty?”</p>

<p>“Too old.”</p>

<p>“Why, he’s only forty something.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to have young men for this job.”</p>

<p>“Then you think it’s very—”</p>

<p>“No.” Cheviot cut her short. “Not if the right men
are doing it—a mere matter of precision,” and he was
going back.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Locke kept him yet a moment. “I’ve just
heard if one of those ropes is cut the fraction of a second
before the others the boat’ll be dragged under?”</p>

<p>“It’s got to be done simultaneously, of course, on a
signal,” he answered quietly. “I’ve just been explaining
to Hildegarde it isn’t a job for bunglers.”</p>

<p>“They say it oughtn’t to be attempted unless by a disciplined
crew.”</p>

<p>“But there isn’t any disciplined crew,”—he was in
the act of stepping across the chain—“and there isn’t
any other way of getting off the bar.”</p>

<p>“There are <em>other men</em>,” said Mrs. Locke, quite low.</p>

<p>“Oh, plenty,” and he was on the other side. But so
was Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“You aren’t allowed over here,” Cheviot said. She
was looking up at the captain and making him a little
signal for permission. He nodded, and without a word
to Cheviot she went up to Gillies on the bridge. In a
few minutes she came down again, but instead of joining
the passengers on the other side of the chain, she made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
her way to where, a little apart from the group of volunteers,
Cheviot stood watching the small boat which,
manned by the first officer, O’Gorman, and two others,
was bobbing about dimly on the roughened water.</p>

<p>Just as Louis caught sight of her one of the volunteers
stepped between them. “What makes those fellows so
devilish slow?”</p>

<p>“Doing the best they can,” said Cheviot, with an air
of not meaning to notice the girl.</p>

<p>“No, they aren’t doing the best they can. They
aren’t even getting our boat lowered.”</p>

<p>“They’ve had to knock off work a minute. The
wind’s playing the mischief with the head-sails.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and if we don’t look sharp the wind’ll play the
mischief with more than the head-sails.”</p>

<p>The volunteer looked across Cheviot’s shoulder an instant
into the thicker fog. Through that veil no man
might yet discover if the ice were being driven back
against the bar, but all could feel that the need for quick
action might be greater than the fog would let them see.</p>

<p>The instant the volunteer went back to the waiting
group, Hildegarde drew close to the solitary figure at the
railing. “Louis!”</p>

<p>Whether at something new in the girl’s low voice, or
at a simultaneous shrill dissonance in the thick, chill air,
Cheviot started and looked round. “Oh, it’s those
Chinamen!” he said, his eyes on the blue-cotton crew
hauling at a rope with a kind of wicked hilarity as they
sang their barbaric, disquieting chant.</p>

<p>But it was a new experience to find that anything
could get on Louis’s nerves!</p>

<p>“Is it true you’ve been up all night?” Hildegarde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
said hurriedly, scanning his face. He nodded, and
turned seaward again to watch the little boat planting
out bright-colored buoys in the mist.</p>

<p>“Louis, the captain says I may speak to you. Only
five minutes, so we mustn’t waste time pretending. It’s
dangerous what you mean to do. Oh, don’t be afraid!
I’m not going to try to prevent your going. Only, if
you don’t come back, Louis”—her voice fell—“I shan’t
know how to go on living.”</p>

<p>For a moment he made no answer, and then, with his
eyes still on the dim boat dancing in the mist: “You’re
only rather frightened,” he said. “Wait till all this
has gone by.”</p>

<p>“Ah, can’t you see? Why is it so hard for you to believe?”</p>

<p>“Because,” he said very low, “I know if I did, it
would be the signal for the old barrier to rise up again.”</p>

<p>“What barrier? You aren’t thinking—”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking this isn’t the place for you to—” He
checked himself.</p>

<p>“For me to do what?”</p>

<p>“To get rid of your old—” Again he stopped, and
then, with an effect of rather bitter patience, “Of course
for you he’s the dominating thought up here among the
ice.”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say he hasn’t been in your mind a
hundred times? Continually?”</p>

<p>“Not continually, because—”</p>

<p>“Well, a hundred remembrances would satisfy most
men,” he said.</p>

<p>“Would it satisfy you, Louis?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I should want all, and I know there’s no chance
of getting all here.”</p>

<p>“I suppose this isn’t the time for me to tell you—”</p>

<p>He turned on her almost roughly. “You can’t suppose
I need to be told what was in your mind when we
got caught in the ice? And when that first ship showed
on the horizon—” He stopped again, and turned away
as one who has said all.</p>

<p>“You”—the mere suggestion took away her breath—“you
didn’t think it might be—”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> did.”</p>

<p>“No, no. I knew, dead or alive, he was on the other
side of the world. Or, at nearest, in California.”</p>

<p>“I don’t tempt him by being sure.” The rigid line of
his lips looked less like firmness than an effort at control.
“If I were to be sure again, especially here, the fog
there would open and a ship come sailing through. And
it would be his ship. And in a moment your ship, too.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know for him to be up here is physically
impossible, even if he’s alive?”</p>

<p>Cheviot shook his head. “There are some men—even
their ghosts can fight their battles. <em>His</em> did, once before.”</p>

<p>“I could never have believed you were superstitious.”</p>

<p>“Mayn’t I have even that much imagination?”</p>

<p>“You’ve forgotten it was all just a dream of mine.
Why”—she couldn’t help giving out a little miserable
laugh—“you’ve forgotten, just as I used to, that I’ve
never seen him?”</p>

<p>“I remember I used to wish you had.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s one thing you can’t remember, because
you never knew it. And that is that I had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
seen <em>you</em> in the Valdivia days. It was partly my fault,
but not altogether. Men’s lives are so hidden from girls.
How is it possible for us to know them? We never see
them doing things that are worth while. We haven’t
a notion what they’re like when they’re at work.
Only, about <em>one</em> man’s work I used to think I knew. Of
course I didn’t, but just to imagine it was something.
I was the kind of girl who isn’t ambitious for herself.
But for the man she—The reason that old ‘obsession,’
as you called it, took such hold of me, was that <em>there</em> was
a man who was ‘doing things’! I’d heard all my life
about the things he’d done and the things he meant to
do. They seemed already made immortal in a book. But
now I’ve seen it isn’t only he—”</p>

<p>The contrast in achievement cut too cruelly. Cheviot
struck the damp railing with his open palm, and laughed
out loud.</p>

<p>Though his action dashed her into trembling she
drew closer, she pressed against his arm. “Besides, I’ve
come at last to care for some one in the only true way—quite
apart from anything he may do. I—I love you,
Louis.”</p>

<p>The look he turned upon her was very beautiful to the
girl. As his hand moved toward her along the railing,
under cover of the cape, her own slipped into it.</p>

<p>The wild chant of the Chinamen abruptly ended, and
now that nearer, more intelligible sound, the creaking
of the falls as the long boat sank from the davits to the
sea.</p>

<p>Cheviot, with an effort, turned his eyes away from the
girl’s face. Together they watched the boat floated over
the great anchor that was suspended lengthwise a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
under the surface of the water; together saw the binding
fast of the anchor to the boat. And now the two made
one were ready. Cheviot took off his overcoat and flung
it over the railing. “Will you have an eye to that?”</p>

<p>Her heart was beating painfully. “Do you think I’ll
have an eye to spare?”</p>

<p>“Well, keep this in your pocket then.” He took off
his watch. “And here’s this.” He put a little leather
case in her hand, smiling and saying hurriedly, under
his breath: “With all my worldly goods I thee endow.”
Then facing about he signaled to his volunteers.</p>

<p>In the undisciplined fashion of her sex, Hildegarde,
forgetting to go back behind the barrier, stood at gaze.
Cheviot, carrying with him something quick and quivering
out of the heart of the girl (something that kept her
linked to him not by eye and mind alone, but as by a
bond that established oneness of the very flesh, faithfully
reporting effort and transmitting feeling), he disappeared
over the ship’s side after the officer, followed by the six
volunteers. With steady eyes the girl watched the buffeting
of the heavy-weighted boat, and watched the fog
blur it till it looked like something seen in a dream. Cheviot
at the bow, by the uniformed figure, less distinct
both of them than the big German with his black-and-yellow
cap at the stern.</p>

<p>Now the “kedgers” were passing the small boat, and
now they had gained the buoys. Hildegarde saw the
officer turn, and knew he was giving some direction.
Now they were trying to steady the pitching boat directly
over the selected site, shown by a buoy faintly
vermilion, bobbing to right and to left.</p>

<p>No easy affair to keep the boat there long enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
plant the great anchor. The officer stood up, and in a
sudden lurch all but capsized, steadied himself and
seemed to wait. There was a shipping of oars; the picture
danced and then dissolved.</p>

<p>No, no, there it was! But what had happened, why
did it look so strange? The men! there wasn’t one in
the boat. And so many dim buoys—no, <em>heads</em>! Lord,
Lord, have mercy! The boat was turned completely
over and drowning men were clinging to the keel. Were
they all there! Which was Louis? One couldn’t even
count, for the waves would wash over a man and wipe
him out. A moment, and there he was again! That,
<em>that</em> was Louis! Could he keep hold on the plunging
keel? (Lord God, be kind!) But he seemed not to have
been washed away. He was swimming to the place
where a man had been and was no more. Now Louis had
hold of him. And there was the other boat—the little
one, as though she’d dropped from the skies, or risen
from the bed of the ocean; and she was taking a man on
board! Not Louis, but the one who had once gone down—the
huge German. Two men! Three were hauled in. Not
one of them Louis! He kept a hand on the gunwale
of the overcrowded little boat, and swam with it toward
the buoys. Why was he and those others still struggling
in the water, what were they trying to do? To right
the long boat? Oh, let it alone and come back!</p>

<p>After endless moments, Louis and the rest, with the
help of the men in the small boat, had got the other right
side up again. Now both crews were coming back.</p>

<p>When at last in a shower of cheers, Cheviot, the last
of the volunteers, climbed the swinging ladder and
smiled up at the face bending over—not till then did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
it seem to Hildegarde that the something he had taken
away was restored to her, and her body and her soul
made whole again.</p>

<p>The people broke through the barrier and pressed
round the dripping figures, hurrahing too loud at first
to hear how everything was “all right now.” They’d
got the anchor where they wanted it, and they hadn’t
lost an inch of cable, and had got a ducking only because
a few strands of the confounded rope hung up
the falling anchor a fraction of a second longer on one
side than on the other.</p>

<p>Very quickly Cheviot seemed to have enough of public
enthusiasm. “You might just let us by, so we can get
into dry things.” But the horde pressed closer. How
was this, and how was that? And how the onlookers
felt in that awful moment when the boat capsized. In
vain Cheviot assured them, “Nobody’s a penny the
worse, and the kedging can begin as soon as the tide
comes in.” Nobody the worse? Yes, one man was.
Since he couldn’t get away, Cheviot created a diversion
by laughing at the wet and angry German, who stood
outside the press, oblivious of other people’s excitement,
his own face working with emotion, stretching out his
arms and apostrophizing his black-and-yellow cap that
floated like some gay sea-bird on the troubled waters.
He appealed to the officer to let him go back in the
small boat and rescue the precious object.</p>

<p>“You’d better go and get dry, Guggenheim, for the
sake of your family,” Cheviot called out, and then to
those nearest, “You talk about grit. I tell you we had
<em>one</em> hero in our crew and one fool, and both together
made one large-sized Dutchman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>“Guggenheim?”</p>

<p>“Guggenheim. What do you think? That fellow volunteered
without being able to swim!”</p>

<p>There was a roar of laughing amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes, and when we were out there, and the waves
were playing battledore with our boat, the fellow says,
quite calmly, ‘Ob ve go opsot you fellows yoost most
safe me.’ ‘Save yourself?’ says the officer. ‘I not can
svim,’ says the volunteer, and then he told us quite
firmly, ‘You shall safe me for dat I haf a vife and four
childs wid a baby. You vill know me,’ he says, ‘from
my cap.’”</p>

<p>As Cheviot at last pushed his way out of the crush,
Hildegarde, close in his wake, still carrying the overcoat,
followed him down the companionway. Near the
deserted music-room door she slipped her hand in his.</p>

<p>“I’m too wet for you to come near.” But his eyes
said nothing of the sort, and dripping as he was, he had
her in his arms.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-l.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Late the next evening, standing with Louis
and Captain Gillies on the bridge, Hildegarde
saw ships on the western horizon.
The fleet at last! anchored two miles off
from Nome. It was bedtime, but quite impossible
to sleep, though there would be no landing till
next day. They said “Good-night” to the captain, and
found their way to a corner of the deck, where alone
together they might see the belated sun setting, and
watch a pale-gold moon of enormous size riding portentously
the clear-colored sky, too bright for stars. Hand
in hand, hidden among the freight, they talked of the
future, arranging it in the high fashion of the young,
as though they two had been gods seated on Olympus.
And as they talked the faint flush over yonder turned
the purest rose, then deepened as each beautiful moment
sped, till the sun, gone but now, hastened back like one
who abandons a projected journey, and on the heels of
his good-by comes shamefaced home. What would it be
like, this day that he was bringing? What was waiting
over yonder in that mysterious land, still in shadow,
that skirts the hills of Nome? Just a little longer the
weary passengers hung about the decks, while the blood-red
sun peered at them over a violet sea, ready, when the
shadow-curtain lifted, to clothe the naked truth of
Nome with a final splendor. Whatever might come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
after, in this first actual vision of the place people had
fared so far to find, it was to wear the hues of heaven.
For the “boat-load of failure,” the dream they had
called “Nome” was to die in a glory of gold and fire.</p>

<p>The decks that had swarmed with excited people were
falling silent. Men and women, whose whole lives hung
upon what they should find waiting for them yonder,
must be in bed betimes, that they might be ready to go
ashore in the first boat. Soon only Hildegarde and Cheviot
remained. But they were silent, watching all those
white sails turn pink against the purple distance—sea
and sky alike dyed deep, and still the honey-colored
moon hanging there, immense, unreal. Whichever way
they looked, this northern world was like something
seen in a dream, spectral, uncanny, fitly ushered in by
the sunrise in the night.</p>

<p>To Hildegarde, as though given in that hour some
gift of prophecy, it seemed that after all her journeying
the land she looked on was still beyond the reach of
sober day, fated to be for ever outside the experience of
waking hours.</p>

<p>Yet this incredible country for two years had been her
father’s home!</p>

<p>Louis would go ashore in the first boat and prepare
Nathaniel Mar for his daughter’s coming.</p>

<p>“If I were alone I should be imagining he might be
dead.” Even as she said “if,” an inward dread clutched
at her.</p>

<p>“If you were alone I should be imagining things worse
than death.” They drew together. As he held her,
looking down into her eyes, a new gravity came into his
own. “Are you sure <em>at last</em>?” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>“You know I am. But I don’t scold you for asking.
It’s the more beautiful of you to have quite realized
and yet—yet not despise me for all that romantic feeling
about some one I’ve never seen.”</p>

<p>“Your mother once helped me there.”</p>

<p>“My mother! What does she know about—”</p>

<p>“More than you might think. When I’d lost patience
one day, she told me the only difference between you
and other girls was that you were honester and stubborner
than most.”</p>

<p>“I can hear her saying ‘stubborner.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it was curious to hear her saying few
women, if they remember their youth, can truthfully
say it went by without some such—well—she called it
names—”</p>

<p>“I know one of them. Some such silly ‘infatuation.’”
Hildegarde smiled, but not he. “I wonder if my mother
ever—Oh, it’s a wild idea!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. She said it was usually either a
great soldier or a clergyman, often an actor, sometimes
a poet, or ‘even a bachelor statesman.’ And she said
that last with such an edge in her voice I wondered at
the time what American statesman was still unmarried
when Mrs. Mar was in her ’teens.” And their own
cloud was dispersed in smiling at another’s.</p>

<p>Hildegarde, coming on deck at six o’clock, found sunshine
whitening all the thousand tents of Nome. Frame
dwellings, too, the eye found out—one standing boldly
forth with flag flying. That, Blumpitty said, was the
hospital. Was her father there? Courage! Louis was
at her side, with confident looks and shining eyes that
saw no shadow save the purple splotch in the sea to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
left—“Sledge Island.” Had she noticed the snow-seamed
hills? She must take his glass and look at that
higher lift in the low, undulant line; could she see a
queer knob? “<em>Anvil Rock!</em>” But the main impression
up the beach, and down the beach, and away over
the tundra, was tents, tents. And between the <i>Los Angeles</i>
and the surf-whitened shore, sails, sails! Ships of
every size and kind. Big steamers from Seattle, from
San Francisco, Portland, and Vancouver, smart sailing
vessels, lumbering freight boats, whalers, and among
them—darting back and forth like a flock of brown
sparrows under the gleaming wings of seagulls—were
myriads of little skiffs, dories, lighters, canoes, and here
and there a steam launch, bobbing, swarming, surrounding
“the last boat in,” and ready to take all and sundry
to Nome for dazzling sums.</p>

<p>While the more enterprising of the <i>Los Angeles’</i> contingent
(swallowing their resentment at the captain’s
failure to set them instantly ashore) bargained with the
owners of the small craft, a rumor ran about the ship
that not even a millionaire might leave till certain formalities
had been complied with. But Cheviot had in
some way got a special permit to go ashore with one of
the officers.</p>

<p>While Hildegarde waited after breakfast for his return,
she tried to deaden fear of the news he might bring
back, listening to the scraps of talk between the touting
boatmen and the passengers longingly suspended over the
<i>Los Angeles’</i> side.</p>

<p>Some old acquaintance called out “Howdy” to the
bean-feaster, and after hearing what the Commission
had settled in far away Washington, screamed back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
Nome news in return. They were “havin’ a red hot
roarin’ boom,” and Jolly Haley had made a million.
One of the great steamers was spoken as she moved
majestically by. Others, besides the <i>Los Angeles</i>, were
overdue, the captain of the <i>Akron</i> said. Those haggard
wrecks down there toward Cape Nome—they were only
two, but the Bering Sea was full of ships disabled or
gone down in these last days. Gillies asked for news of
friends and rivals. The <i>Congress</i> had put into Dutch
Harbor “for repairs,” he was told, and the men exchanged
grim smiles. The <i>Santa Ana</i> was burned to
within two feet of the water. The passengers on the
<i>Chiquita</i> had been all but starved to death, and the <i>St.
John</i> had made escape from the ice-pack only to go to
pieces on the rocks. Then, like some sentient thing exulting
in her enviable fate, the <i>Akron</i> steamed away in
the sunshine.</p>

<p>Popular interest shifted to starboard when the whaler
<i>Beluga</i> drew ’longside. Her captain, a hard-looking
customer, came on board the <i>Los Angeles</i> to talk to Gillies.
O’Gorman discovered a man he knew on board the
whaler. “Going to Nome?” he asked him. “No, better
than that. Gettin’ out.” Where was the ex-Nomite off
to? “Up the coast.” The <i>Beluga</i> was to meet some
south-bound whalers up in Grantley Harbor in a day or
two—might come south herself afterward, or might go
still farther north to Kotzebue. O’Gorman’s friend
didn’t care where, just so it wasn’t Nome. The people
of the <i>Los Angeles</i> only laughed. Clear that fellow was
a hoodoo. The more luck in Nome, since he was leaving
it!</p>

<p>“He might be able to give you news about your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
father,” O’Gorman said aside to Miss Mar. But before
she answered he saw, from the sudden fear in the girl’s
face, that she couldn’t risk having bawled at her in
public tidings that more and more she dreaded.</p>

<p>“He—Mr. Cheviot will soon be back,” she said.</p>

<p>“Has he been in Nome all winter?—your <i>Beluga</i>
friend?” Mrs. Locke asked O’Gorman.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to inquire about my firm, Dixon and Blumenstein.”
O’Gorman called out the question for
her.</p>

<p>“Lots o’ folks inquirin’ ’bout Dixon and Blumenstein,”
the man on the whaler roared back.</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Lit out.”</p>

<p>“Gone away?”</p>

<p>“You bet.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Busted.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Locke, what shall you do?” While Hildegarde,
vaguely aware of the unusual sound of a dog
howling distractedly, stood beside the woman who in
those seconds had seen her hoped-for home, her very
bread swept from her, Louis’s voice was audible over
the girl’s shoulder. Hildegarde turned to find herself
in her father’s arms. She did not notice how wet he
was with sea-water. “Oh, you are ill!” she faltered.</p>

<p>“My child! My child!” he kept repeating, and
then: “What a journey!”</p>

<p>“But you see I’ve got to Nome all right.”</p>

<p>“To Nome! God forbid!”</p>

<p>“But God hasn’t forbidden,” said the girl, swallowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
the sob that sight of the haggard face had brought
into her throat. She was conscious, too, that her fellow-travelers
were eagerly listening to the colloquy.</p>

<p>“I’ve been telling Cheviot I can’t think how he could
allow you—” Mr. Mar caught himself up and laid his
hand affectionately on the young man’s shoulder. “Of
course Louis didn’t really know. The Nome he left was
bad enough, but that Nome has passed away. To-day
it isn’t a place for a girl to stay in an hour.”</p>

<p>“’Sh! father! You’ll scare my friends. This is Mrs.
Blumpitty. She thinks very highly of Nome. And this
is Mr. Blumpitty. Mother put me under their care,
and they’ve been <em>so</em> kind. They’ve brought a big party
up again this year. We’ve all come believing great
things of the new camp.”</p>

<p>The moment the handshaking was over, “This way,”
Cheviot said, and while the talk buzzed, and the dog
somewhere down yonder among the swarming rowboats
howled dismally, and questions showered on the man
from Nome, Louis was leading Mr. Mar toward the companionway.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Hildegarde, “my suit-case and things.
But father needn’t trouble to come below. I’ve had
everything packed and ready <em>for hours</em>!” She smiled
at Cheviot across the halting figure. “What kept you
so, Louis? Couldn’t you find him?”</p>

<p>“You can’t get along very fast over there,” Cheviot
answered.</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> couldn’t?”</p>

<p>“Nobody can. There’s a wall of stuff piled higgledy-piggledy
for a mile along the shore.”</p>

<p>“Dingleys and McKeowns, and—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and grub. Tons of it. Hundreds of barrels of
whisky. Thousands of bags of flour and beans piled
higher than my head. Lumber—acres of it. Furniture
and bedding, engines and boilers, mixed up with sides
of bacon and blankets, and a sprinkling of centrifugal
pumps and Klondike thawers. How they’ll ever sort
that chaos—”</p>

<p>“The next high tide will save them the trouble,” said
Nathaniel Mar.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a queer sight. Hundreds and hundreds
of people, Hildegarde, sitting on top of their worldly
goods, looking as if they’d never stir again. Like so
many Robinson Crusoes, each one on his own desert
island, among the wreck of his possessions.” Hildegarde
smiled. Louis was only pointing out that Nome justified
his prophecy. A form of “I told you so.” But he was
speaking to her father. “And the faces! You’re used
to them, but I—” He caught Hildegarde’s significant
little smile and deliberately changed the tune. “Of
course there’s a lot of hustling, too,” he ended, stopping
by the smoking-room door.</p>

<p>“Yes, the old story,” said Hildegarde’s father, wearily.
“All land there free and equal from the common
life of the ships. Twenty minutes, and some are masters
and others are slaves.”</p>

<p>“I thought there’d be no one here!” Cheviot said
with satisfaction, as he held open the door.</p>

<p>“Isn’t the boat ready to take us back?” Hildegarde
asked.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said her father, leaning heavily on his
stick and looking at her from under his bushy eyebrows,
“you think we’ve got hotels over yonder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t even a boarding-house—”</p>

<p>“Mrs. L’Estrange <em>will</em> be glad! She’s going to set
up the very thing, and make her everlasting fortune.”</p>

<p>“Well, <em>I’m</em> glad”—Mar dropped into the nearest
seat—“very glad you’re a sensible girl and take it like
that.”</p>

<p>Imagine his thinking she’d come expecting a hotel
and all the comforts of home! That was why he seemed
so harassed. “Poor father!” She put an arm about his
crooked shoulders. It had been hard for him to make
his way over the chaos of the beach, and he had got so
wet coming out. How thoughtful of that dear Louis
to bring him in here to rest before undertaking the return
trip.</p>

<p>The old man crossed his wrinkled hands on the knob
of his heavy stick and slowly shook his head. “No,
Nome wasn’t Paradise before, but since the invasion it’s
a hell upon earth.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father!”</p>

<p>“Well, think of it! Something like forty thousand
homeless people stranded over yonder on the beach.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad <em>you</em> haven’t been one of the homeless
ones,” she said gently.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how glad you’d be if you saw my one-roomed
tent on the boggy tundra.”</p>

<p>“Dearest.” She took off his big soft hat that impeached
his dignity with an absurd operatic air, and she
stroked the whitened hair. “It’s well I”—she looked
across at her lover—“<em>we’ve</em> come to look after you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m one of the fortunate Nomites! I tell you a
man with <em>any</em> sort of shelter over his head is in luck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
Hundreds are sleeping on the beach in the cold and
rain.”</p>

<p>“Silly people not to buy a tent.”</p>

<p>“Most of them did, and can’t get it landed or can’t
find it in the hurly-burly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope mine won’t get lost!”</p>

<p>“<em>Yours!</em>”</p>

<p>“Yes, father, I’ve got a tent and two pairs of Hudson
Bay blankets, waterproof boots, stout netting—for the
mosquitoes, you know. Oh, I have heard all about those
mosquitoes! I’ve got a canvas knapsack and an oil-stove,
and oceans of oil, and a pistol and plenty of chocolates
and six weeks’ provisions.” With a little encouragement
she would have told him every item in that six
weeks’ provision. She was distinctly proud of her list.
Many people on the <i>Los Angeles</i> had complimented her
upon its judicious selection.</p>

<p>But Nathaniel Mar’s face showed no pride—showed
something even like horror. “I can’t think what you
were about, Cheviot,” he said almost sharply.</p>

<p>Hildegarde was still incredulous that Louis had been
able to resist the natural temptation of “telling on her,”
and saving his own credit. “Doesn’t father know—anything?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I told him—about us.”</p>

<p>“It’s the one redeeming feature in the present situation,”
said Mr. Mar.</p>

<p>“Father!” She was really wounded by that.</p>

<p>“But as I’ve told you already”—he turned his melancholy
eyes on the young man—“I’d take more comfort
in the intelligence if you hadn’t brought her up
here!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>

<p>“Does he say he brought me?”</p>

<p>“He can’t say he prevented you.”</p>

<p>“I <em>would</em> come. I was afraid we’d never get you
back.” She was on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said Cheviot briskly, “it’s no use
spilling milk.”</p>

<p>“No,” agreed the old man. “It might be worse. After
all, the ship is going back in a week and I’ll make
arrangements for you to live on board till then.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde withdrew her arm. She came and stood in
front of the bowed old man. “You can’t mean that
while I <em>am</em> here, I’m not to stay with you—or in my
own tent near—”</p>

<p>“Your tent!” Mr. Mar lifted one hand, calling
heaven to witness his offspring’s folly. “As to ‘near’
<em>me</em>, I’m sleeping in a ghastly lodging-house myself at
the moment. We pay ten dollars a night for floor space.
Spread a blanket on filthy boards, and try to get some
rest in spite of drunken rows and vermin.”</p>

<p>“I should think even a tent in the bog was better than
that.”</p>

<p>“Much. I’ve lent mine for a few nights to a miserable
woman and her daughter, who’d slept a week on
the beach. Like Hildegarde here, they ‘bought a tent!’
It’s on that steamer we passed. There are half a dozen
ships that can’t get unloaded.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I like those other women living in
your tent,” said Hildegarde, with frank envy.</p>

<p>“Some of us are arranging to get the daughter home.”</p>

<p>“Not the mother?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“She’s going to stay?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<p>“She’s got consumption.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“They came in the steerage. No, the mother won’t go
home, and won’t need my tent long, I think.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde stroked his hand. “It was like you, father,
to give them shelter.”</p>

<p>“It’s been pretty much as you saw it this morning”—Mar
turned to Louis—“for two weeks now. People are
paralyzed. The fall from the height of their anticipations
has stunned them. The women sit and wait. For
what, they don’t know. The men drink and play high, and
when they’re cleaned out and can’t think of anything
else to do, they shoot. There were two men killed last
night in a fight over a lot. In the last week there have
been six suicides. Nobody minds. What’s the spilling
of a little blood? A thing far more important is the
scarcity of water. You buy it by the small bucketful
and carry it home yourself. If you don’t boil it, you
get typhoid. The mayor told somebody that, after all,
we lacked only two things here—water and good society.
The stranger said: ‘It’s all the damned lack.’” It
was as striking to ears that heard the retort then for the
first time as though the saying had not grown hoary.
“You’ll see,” Mar said, as though Cheviot had denied
such a possibility, “it’ll be worse here than ever Dawson
was in the toughest times. We haven’t got any such
body of men to keep the peace as the mounted police.”</p>

<p>“And to think it’s all your fault, father.”</p>

<p>Mar stared at her.</p>

<p>“Two years ago and nobody cared a pin to go to
Nome. You couldn’t induce the boys to come. You
had to bribe even Louis. Now forty thousand people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
and all that tangle on the beach.” Her eyes were eager.
“Nome, at this minute, must be the most wonderful
sight in the world.”</p>

<p>“It’s the dump-heap of the nations! I’ll tell you
what happened a week ago.” Mr. Mar was almost voluble
in his anxiety to convince his daughter of the unfitness
of Nome as a subject of feminine curiosity. “I’d
been to the A.C. store and got a small draft cashed.
Then I went up to Penny River and was gone all day.
As I came back, behind the big Music Hall tent, I was
held up. Two men turned out my pockets and made off
with my thirty dollars. It was no use reporting the
robbery. I was very tired, and I went to bed. I was
waked up by some one rummaging about. But before I
realized what was happening inside, I saw there were
holes cut in the off wall of my tent, and two pairs of eyes
were watching me. A little lower down the bores of a
couple of pistols were sticking through. I lay perfectly
still, and presently the man inside, who’d been going
through my grip-sack, threw it down. ‘Where do you
keep your stuff, anyhow?’ he said, and then I recognized
him. ‘You’re not in luck. You’ve got hold of the
same person twice,’ I said. ‘Think we didn’t know
that?’ he said. ‘We made such a devilish poor haul we
thought we’d give you another chance. Come along,’
he said, ‘where do you keep the rest?’ And when he
found there wasn’t anything in the tent but a match
and a pistol—well, he was good enough to tell me his
opinion of me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand—isn’t it daylight all night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but some of the honest people try to sleep, and
then the crooks take over the town. The place is full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
the professional criminal class. And if it weren’t,
Nome, as it is to-day, would breed them. My next-door
neighbor says if he owned all the Nome district and
owned hell, he’d sell Nome and live in hell.”</p>

<p>“But the thing that brought everybody here—the
gold!”</p>

<p>“The sour-doughs are getting some out of the creeks.
But there aren’t any more windfalls for late comers,
since the beach was worked out.”</p>

<p>“I did see one or two cheechalkers rocking in a hole
here and there,” said Cheviot.</p>

<p>“Go back to-morrow; you won’t see the same faces.
‘Poor man’s country!’—where bread costs more than
luxuries anywhere else on earth! Any business that’s
done in Nome to-day is buying and selling and brokerage
precisely as it is in Wall Street. For the moneyless mass
there isn’t only disappointment, there isn’t only hardship;
there’s acute suffering down on the beach. I don’t
know, for my part, where it’s going to end.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind not staying <em>long</em>,” said Miss Mar
obligingly, “in a place where you wake up to find
pistols and eyes peering in at you; but I wouldn’t, <em>for all
the world</em>, I wouldn’t miss just seeing it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mar moved his stick impatiently.</p>

<p>“<em>I’d</em> be willing enough to miss seeing it,” said Cheviot,
“and I’m not squeamish either. But, Lord! some
of those faces!”</p>

<p>The old man nodded. “I keep away from the water
front as much as I can. Can’t stand it. I’ve never
seen such despair in human eyes. If there are lost
souls on the earth, I’ve seen them on the beach at
Nome.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I dare say a little of it will go a long way with
me, too.”</p>

<p>“Hildegarde, you’re growing very like your mother.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, father,” said the girl, imperturbably.</p>

<p>“The trouble is if you insisted on having ‘a little’ of
Nome, you might have to take a great deal,” Cheviot
said.</p>

<p>“Why might I?”</p>

<p>He exchanged a look with Mr. Mar. “Come out here,
Hildegarde, and I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>As she followed to the ship’s side, “What makes the
dog howl so?” she asked. “Look! he’ll be out of that
little boat in a minute—he’ll be drowned.”</p>

<p>Cheviot leaned over. “Shut up!” he called down.
“Say, <em>Red</em>! D’you hear? Shut up, I tell you!”</p>

<p>The dog looked critically at Cheviot, ears cocked, nose
pointed, forefeet on the gunwale of the lighter, which
was bobbing about at the foot of the <i>Los Angeles’</i> ladder.</p>

<p>“Louis, is that father’s Reddy? Oh, I do so want to
make friends with him! Red! Red! how d’you do? Be
a good dog, we’re coming down in a minute.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get one of the sailors to bring him up. Here”—Cheviot
adjusted his glass for her—“now look off there
to the right—farther, beyond the wreck of the <i>Pioneer</i>.
Do you see that big tent with the flag?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Can you see what flag it is?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t Stars and Stripes. It looks all yellow.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Who are the people who have a yellow flag?”</p>

<p>“The people who have smallpox. That’s the pest-house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>On their way back they met Blumpitty asking, sadder
than ever, if anybody knew how soon quarantine was
going to be declared. “Pretty rough on the people who
get shut out,” murmured Blumpitty.</p>

<p>“Rougher on those who get shut in,” said Cheviot.</p>

<p>Joslin was furious at either prospect. “Damned nonsense,”
he said, “spoilin’ the finest boom since ’49, all
on account of a little smallpox.”</p>

<p>They found Mr. Mar in the smoking-room, in the same
weary attitude, head hung over his wide breast, hat
hung on the sound knee, wooden leg stiffly slanting, eyes
among the cigar ashes on the floor.</p>

<p>“Whatever else I do, father, I can’t go home without
<em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll take you home, my dear,” said Mar, with
alacrity. “I’ve nothing to keep me here now, except my
claims at Polaris.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the girl, losing some of her gloom, “have
you got a share in the Mother Lode?”</p>

<p>He smiled faintly at miners’ superstition on his
daughter’s lips. “I’ve got something worth looking
after,” he said, “though, as I told Louis, I wish my good
luck wasn’t always so inaccessible. Only two boats
touched Polaris last year. I don’t know how it will be
this summer. I wasn’t able to go in either of those
that have set off so far. But I sent up a man to do the
assessment work.”</p>

<p>“I’ll find a way of seeing what he’s made of his
job.” Cheviot seemed to ratify some arrangement.
Then turning to Hildegarde: “And I’ll follow you in
the first ship.”</p>

<p>“Follow? Can’t you go and get back in a week?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span></p>

<p>“I might, if there should happen to be a boat.” He
was touchingly pleased at Hildegarde’s unwillingness to
go home without him.</p>

<p>Quite suddenly she remembered O’Gorman’s loud-voiced
friend of the whaler. “I’ve got an inspiration,”
she said gaily. “Why shouldn’t we all three go up to
Polaris in the bark <i>Beluga</i>? Yes, yes, that whaler
alongside is going north in a day or two. Now, don’t
say it’s impossible till you see.” Quickly she outlined
a delightful plan. They could all come back in one of
the boats waiting about in Grantley Harbor. Or why
shouldn’t they (after they’d attended to the Mother
Lode), why shouldn’t they go in the <i>Beluga</i> as far as
Kotzebue? Nobody realized in the very least, she said,
her immense interest in all this queer northern world.
And after what she’d gone through to get here, they
wanted to forbid her Nome! Adroitly she spoke, as
though their success were still a matter of doubt. <em>If</em>
she didn’t see Nome, oh, how she’d be laughed at in
Valdivia! But <em>if</em> she didn’t, why shouldn’t she be a
little compensated for so huge a disappointment? But
that wasn’t the main consideration. How could anybody
expect her to go away in this very same horrible
boat that had brought her, and go <em>without</em> Louis? Was
her father grown so hard-hearted up here as to expect
to part them when they’d only just found each other?
Half-smiling, but serious enough in reality, as Mar could
see, she pleaded for her plan. Louis was plainly a convert,
though he did say in a feeble and highly unconvinced
fashion, that if he hadn’t used up all his credit
with her on the subject of travel, he’d point out that
the accommodation on board these coasting vessels—</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>don’t</em> be so careful of me—you two!” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
wailed. “The reasons why I mustn’t see Nome surely
don’t apply to Polaris. Why mayn’t I have a look at
that miraculous Mother Lode? Besides, Polaris! why,
that’s where Blumpitty’s hermit lives! Dearest father,
I’ve been dying to see the hermit. Was it he who told
you, too, where to get claims?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. I wouldn’t go near the imposter!
Living on people’s greedy hopes. That’ll come to an
end, too, some fine day!”</p>

<p>“Well, if it hasn’t come to an end yet, you won’t
mind my seeing him, will you, dearest? It isn’t just idle
curiosity. You really ought to sympathize a little. I must
have got it from you—all this interest in the North, that
we used to think was left out of the rest of the family.
Don’t you remember, I never wondered at the hold it
had on you? Even when I was quite little—” She
pulled herself up suddenly, with an anxious glance at
Cheviot’s averted face. But he turned briskly at that
first pause and said: “I’ll leave you to butter the
parsnips, Hildegarde, while I tackle the captain.”</p>

<p>When Cheviot had gone, “What’s the news?” said
Mar.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re all well, and the boys are getting on
splendidly. Mother sends you—”</p>

<p>“Nothing yet from Jack Galbraith?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, up to the day I left. Father, it bores
Louis dreadfully, hearing about—arctic exploration.
We won’t talk about Jack Galbraith before Louis. But
I’ve often thought, while I’m crawling up this side of
the round world, Jack is probably sliding down the
other.”</p>

<p>“It’s one of the reasons for going home,” said the old
man, thinking aloud.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">It was after some delay through fogs that,
on a clear July morning to Hildegarde for
ever memorable, the small whaling vessel
<i>Beluga</i> anchored below the cape called
Prince of Wales, that looks across the narrow
Strait of Bering to the Siberian shore. The girl,
with her new friend Reddy at her side, overheard with
inattentive ear her father’s final instructions. Mar,
whose difficulty in getting about was obviously increased
in these months of absence, had agreed to remain on
board. Cheviot’s the task of making the most of the
brief span granted by the surly captain for inquiry into
the condition of the gold camp two miles across the surf,
and two more inland up Polaris Creek.</p>

<p>But if the talk between the men about possible claim-jumpers,
treatment of “tailings,” increase of water-power,
double shifts, and clean-ups—if such matters
held but a modified interest for the girl on this golden
morning, not so the scene itself. Even in the gray light
of yesterday, when, toward bedtime, the thicker fog-veils
lifted enough to show how far the <i>Beluga</i> had gone
out of her course, the girl had thrilled at the misty
vision of the Diomede Islands. For one of these showed
the fringe of Asia. Hildegarde had reached that place
in her journeying where the East was become the West,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
and where to find the farthest limit of the immemorial
Orient you must needs look toward the setting sun.</p>

<p>To-day, coming on deck before she broke her fast,
something in the girl had cried out greeting at her first
glimpse of the coast-line bluffs of extreme northwestern
Alaska, drawn in purple against a radiant east, to the
south receding a little from the shore and fainting into
the blue of snow-flecked hills having a strip of tundra
at their feet.</p>

<p>There, upon that narrow coastwise margin, directly
in front of what from the deck of the <i>Beluga</i> seemed the
highest point in the background, the sunshine picked out
boldly the intense white of the handful of tents that
stood for the settlement of Polaris and the port for the
Polaris mining-camp.</p>

<p>Hildegarde had won her father’s consent, reluctant
though it was, that she should go ashore with Cheviot.
Gaily she assured him it was little compensation enough
to a girl who had foregone the fearful joys of Nome. The
visit of inspection to the Polaris claims would not take
long. As the old man looked at his “two children,” with
the sunshine on their faces, he wondered who would
have the heart to steal from them a single one of those
early hours of enchantment.</p>

<p>Not Nathaniel Mar.</p>

<p>But neither he nor they had bargained for Reddy’s
bearing them company. He announced his intention
unmistakably, when Cheviot went over the ship’s side
into the small boat that was to take him and Hildegarde
through the surf. Mar tried in vain to quiet the beast.
So unnerving were Mr. Reddy’s demonstrations, when
he saw Hildegarde preparing to follow Cheviot, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
Mar called out, Hildegarde must wait till the dog could
be shut up; the sailors could hardly hold him. But the
men below, bobbing about on the rough water, were with
difficulty preventing the boat from being battered
against the ship’s side, and Cheviot was shouting, “No
time to worry with the dog!”</p>

<p>At the same moment, Hildegarde, hanging suspended
between her two counselors on the swinging ladder, saw
a big wave sweeping askew the boat beneath her. From
above her father, and Cheviot from below, called out
“Hold tight,” while Louis supplemented the vain efforts
of the two other men, unable by themselves to
steady the clumsy craft in such a sea. But Hildegarde,
with a conviction that Reddy, escaping out of a sailor’s
arms, was in the act of coming down on her head,
jumped from the ladder and landed in the boat with
the dog and a twisted ankle. Instantly she called up to
her horrified father, “I’m all right, and so is Reddy.”
Whereupon the boat was swung out into open water.
They had gone half a mile before Cheviot discovered
something was amiss. “Nothing the least serious,” she
said, though it would be serious enough for her if she
were cheated of the two or three hours’ wandering
at Louis’s side on this heaven-sent morning through
the wild, sunshiny land across the surf. Cheviot
was for turning round at once and taking
her back to the steamer, but that would be
to prolong by a mile a sufficiently difficult transit.
He would send her back after the boat had landed
him.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she pleaded. “If I can’t walk, I’ll wait
for you on shore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p>But Cheviot was giving the sailors directions about
getting her safely back to the <i>Beluga</i>.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, the girl spoke of the stark
discomfort that reigned aboard the whaler, how she
longed for a little respite, and how she longed—But the
landward-looking eyes could not, down here in the deep
sea furrows, pick out the far-shining tents toward which
the lighter was plunging, down the watery dales and up
on foamy hills, and down again to shining green deeps
that shut out ship and shore—holding the small boat
hugged an uneasy instant in the rocking lap of the sea.
Yet the girl clung to the memory of that early morning
vision from the deck, of violet headlands and snow-filled
hollows, and as the boat rode high again on the top of
the next big breaker, she drew in rapturous breath, saying
softly of the land beckoning her across the furious
surf, “The ‘farthest North’ that I shall know!” But
in the end she owed it to Reddy’s companionship that
Cheviot let her have her way.</p>

<p>“Oh, what an old-fashioned <em>Turk</em> of a man I shall
have to spend my life with!” But she laughed for joy
at the prospect.</p>

<p>As Cheviot, sharply scrutinizing the harborless shore,
directed the boat above the settlement: “Some better
landing-place round the point?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t expect a landing-place on this coast, but I
don’t see even the tumble-down sod hut your father
talked about.”</p>

<p>The boat shot up out of a boiling hollow, and as it
climbed the slippery back of a great wave, Hildegarde
called out, “I see it!”</p>

<p>“The hut? Where?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<p>“All alone, over yonder. Just beyond those rocks.
That’s where you and I will sit and wait, won’t we,
Red? Those rocks are farther north than where the tents
are shining—‘farther north,’ do you hear, Mr. Red?”</p>

<p>Beyond the chaos of boulders, in a cloud of spray, the
boat was not so much beached as daringly run in and her
passengers ejected, all in that breathless instant before
the turbulent water withdrew, carrying out the clumsy
craft as lightly as it would a cork. And now already the
toiling sailors were some yards on their way back, disappearing
round the point. Hildegarde was safe on a
temporary perch, and Reddy much occupied in howling
defiance at each thunderous onslaught of the surf. Cheviot,
thinking to combine the girl’s appeal for “a good
observatory” with his own notion of an easy niche safe
beyond the tide’s reach, went to spy out the land over
there where some mighty storm had piled the rocks. At
sight of a man skulking among the boulders, Cheviot
called out, “Hello!”</p>

<p>With a certain reluctance the bearded figure shuffled
into fuller view. “Hello!” he said, without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Do you belong here?” he was asked.</p>

<p>“Sort o’.”</p>

<p>“Oh—a—anything doing?”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Why, here.”</p>

<p>“<em>Here?</em> What d’ y’ expect anybody to do <em>here</em>?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there a camp just over yonder?”</p>

<p>“Up in the hills. Yep, there’s a camp there all
right.”</p>

<p>“Nothing in it, though?”</p>

<p>“Plenty. Things are boomin’ out there. Thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
you meant <em>here</em>.” And he looked past the new arrivals
in an unpleasant, shifty fashion.</p>

<p>They exchanged glances. Hildegarde was so sure
Louis wouldn’t go away and leave such an individual
hanging about that she felt no surprise at hearing him
offered money “to come along and show the way.”</p>

<p>When the two had agreed on the price of this service,
Cheviot said: “I’ll be ready in a minute. I want to find
a more comfortable seat for this lady,” and off he
bolted toward the rocks.</p>

<p>The man eyed Hildegarde askance, and made some
observation.</p>

<p>“I can’t hear you,” she called, above the noise of the
surf.</p>

<p>He shuffled nearer. “Ain’t you goin’, too?”</p>

<p>“Out to the mines? No.”</p>

<p>“What y’ goin’ t’ do?” he asked.</p>

<p>The girl laughed. “Oh, just stay here and look at
things.”</p>

<p>“What things?” The uneasy eye shot out a sudden
alert beam.</p>

<p>She only smiled, as her own glance wandered to the
wider vision.</p>

<p>“I got some ‘things’ to see after m’self,” he said in a
surly tone. “Guess I ain’t got time to go to no gulch
to-day.”</p>

<p>The girl fell a prey to misgiving lest this incident
should end in dissuading Louis from leaving her at all.
Was her insistence upon coming to result in defeat of
the expedition?</p>

<p>The shifty man had drawn a trifle nearer still and
lowered his voice. “What made yer land here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span></p>

<p>“It didn’t seem to matter where we landed. There’s
no harbor.”</p>

<p>“But here yer so—” It occurred to Hildegarde, for
some inexplicable reason, he was going to add, “so near
that hut,” instead of what he did say, “so fur from
town.”</p>

<p>At the obvious suspicion on the man’s face, Hildegarde
smiled to herself. If this uncouth apparition had inspired
distrust in the new arrivals, their appearance had
precisely the same effect on him.</p>

<p>“Y’ might ’a’ come and gone before anybuddy in the
town knowed we’d had visitors,” he said, with an air
indescribably sly.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, our business isn’t in the town.
We’re nearer the diggings here, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Guess yer been here afore.”</p>

<p>“No, neither of us.”</p>

<p>“Then yer better come along with me and him, an’
have a look at the gulch.”</p>

<p>So he didn’t, after all, want to remain behind and
murder her for her watch!</p>

<p>“No, I shall stay here, and while you and my friend
are gone, I’ll practise shooting at a mark.” As she
drew her little revolver out of her pocket, and the silver
mounting caught the sunlight, she recognized
herself for a very astute person. Louis, if no one
else, might quite well need reminding that she was
armed.</p>

<p>“Y’ won’t go?” the man persisted. “Well, I guess I
ain’t got time fur it neither. I ought to see a man up at
the store.”</p>

<p>In the act of going forward to meet Cheviot with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
information, the unaccountable creature paused to say
over his shoulder: “Yer sure to git a nugget if yer go to
the gulch.”</p>

<p>“I’d go quick enough if I could walk.”</p>

<p>He faced about. “Y’ can’t <em>walk</em>!” It seemed somehow
to make a difference, but he narrowed his little eyes.</p>

<p>“Why can’t yer?”</p>

<p>“I’ve sprained my ankle.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Bad?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so. I’ve been told not to put my foot to
the ground—or else I’d hobble to the town and hunt up
a man I’ve heard lives hereabouts.” Ah, <em>that</em> interested
the disreputable one quite as much, apparently,
as it did Miss Mar. “I wonder if <em>you</em> know him! A
queer, hermit sort of person who discovered the—What’s
the matter?”</p>

<p>“I knowed all along what ye’d come fur.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we didn’t <em>come</em> for that—it was only my idea—but
it’s not much good now I’m crippled.”</p>

<p>“What did yer want to see him fur?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just to hear him talk.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es. I been told they’s a lot would ’a’ liked to
hear him talk, only it’s no go. And people gits tired o’
feedin’ a feller with such a parshallity fur keepin’ his
mouth shut.”</p>

<p>Cheviot had come back with, “Put that away!” as he
caught sight of the revolver. “I’ve made a kind of
chair for you, and lined it with overcoat.” He half carried
her over to the rocks, while she clung to him, sparing
the hurt foot. The man with the long, lank chin-beard,
like the last nine inches of a cow’s tail, watched
proceedings with a critical eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p>“There now!” Louis had established her to his satisfaction.
“And Red’ll take care of you since he’s
grown such a gentleman. You hear, Red?” he admonished
the cock-eared dog.</p>

<p>“Reddy hears, and Reddy’ll do it, but if I weren’t so
hopelessly happy I’d be rather miserable at finding
myself a prisoner. <em>This</em> day of all days in the year!”
And, in spite of Cheviot’s assurance that he wasn’t
going to be long, she looked a little wistfully after her
lover.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” his queer guide hung back a moment
to assure her. “It don’t reely matter as much as you
think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it <em>doesn’t</em>!”</p>

<p>“No, fur he ain’t here.”</p>

<p>“Who? The—”</p>

<p>“Yep—feller y’ come to see.”</p>

<p>She humored him. “You mean the—”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Come along, Father Christmas,” shouted Cheviot,
taking the tundra on a run.</p>

<p>“Father Christmas! D’ ye hear wot he’s callin’
me?”</p>

<p>“Where is he, then?” Hildegarde persisted.</p>

<p>“Dead.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m disappointed to hear that. You <em>are</em> too
young for Father Christmas, but I was beginning to
hope you might be the hermit.”</p>

<p>She took her disappointment so light-heartedly that
the odd creature grinned.</p>

<p>“Golly, don’t I wish I <em>wus</em> ‘the hermit,’” he muttered,
as he scrambled up the tundra after Cheviot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb">What nonsense to talk of being a prisoner! Her eyes
were free to roam, and her heart was light as a bird’s
homing across the shining world toward the shining
future. She must remember always in the happiness
that was coming, how she first had seen it at its vividest
from a throne of rocks, sitting between the tundra and
the sea. Oh, but she was glad she had come! If it was
Cheviot’s mission to see how work went on at the gold
camp, hers no less to see with her own eyes—to get by
heart and keep for ever—the aspect of the world up here
where you touch the skirts of the uttermost North.
Happy, happy chance that vouchsafed the vision on one
of those unmatched days of the short arctic summer
that she’d heard about so long ago—a day that made
you feel never before have you seen the sunshine showering
such a glory on the world, never known such color
on the sea, never felt the sweet wind bringing influence
so magical. You unfurl the banner of your spirit, and
you carry the splendid hour like a flag, looking abroad
and saying: “This is what it is, then, to be alive. And
I—I am still among the living!”</p>

<p>In that same hour, a few yards from where Hildegarde
sat waiting, a man was saying farewell to sun and sea
and all the shining ways of all the world; and this man,
dying in the peat hut at the tundra’s edge, was that one
of all who heap up riches having most to leave behind.</p>

<p>There was nothing about the solitary hovel that specially
arrested the girl’s attention. She had seen several
such on the way, during the delay at Grantley Harbor—rude
makeshift shelters, deserted in favor of the booming
camp at Nome. But Reddy found the sod hut somehow
interesting, even suspicious. He had gone away to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
snuff at the threshold. He tore back to Hildegarde to
report, then off again. Now he had set his sharp nose
against the door, and now he howled softly. In the
momentary lull of surf drawn seaward, to Hildegarde’s
surprise, a responsive whine came weakly forth from the
hut. Whereat Red’s excitement was so great that the
girl forgot her ankle and stood up to quiet him. Why,
the ankle hardly hurt at all! She might have gone—could
she, even now, catch up with Louis? She picked
her way across the rocks with scarce a twinge of pain,
and she climbed upon the thick moss carpet of the
tundra. Of course she could have gone! But Louis was
out of sight. To say sooth, she was in a mood too happy
to be cast down. For, as she had just been feeling, it
was one of those hours when all life seems to be waiting
for one to come and claim it, when a girl feels she has
just this little time for pausing at the gate, to give the
glad eyes full possession before she enters in. She takes
the sunshine on her face, and all her being melts to gold,
and has its little share in making the wide earth shine.
Even her secret dreams are dissolved in the universal
sea. Instead of hoping, fearing, her heart floats like an
idle boat in that shifting iridescence. In the air, instead
of trumpet-call and battle-cry only a long, low singing
on the beach. No; one thing beside—a faint whining
from within a deserted hovel. Again, from without, the
beast before the desolate threshold woke the hill-born
echoes with his howling. Surely a stray dog had got
in there and been unable to get out. She would open
the door barely wide enough to throw him some of the
pilot bread she’d brought in her pocket for luncheon.
She lifted a hand to the rude latch, but, instead of opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
the door outright, sheer habit, with nothing in it of
reflection, made her first of all knock. “Come in,” said
a voice. She started back, and held her breath. Again
that low: “Come in.”</p>

<p>It seemed to her that she must run, and at the same
time even more that she must obey the voice. Oh, why
had she come? Taking uncertain hold of her courage
she pushed the door ajar. Red flung it wide by bounding
in before her. She had time only to see that a man,
half-sitting up on a camp bed, with a gray army blanket
over his knees, was whittling away at a long, narrow
bit of flat wood. She hardly noticed at the moment,
though she remembered later, that when he saw a
stranger at his door, he dropped his knife and made an
automatic action to lay protecting hands on a dingy
bundle, half out, half under the low bed. Hildegarde’s
attention was of necessity centered in the dogs; his,
shaky and half-blind, conducting defense from the foot
of the bed. The girl laid hold on Red’s collar and
dragged him back, although it was plain now she had
done so, that he considered the decrepit animal, half-muffled
in the blanket, as vanquished already and quite unworthy
of more consideration than could be conveyed in
a final volley of scornful howls. After which relief to his
feelings, Hildegarde’s fellow-intruder pointedly turned
his back and went sniffing about the forlorn little room.</p>

<p>“I am sorry we disturbed you,” the girl said to the
hollow-eyed, unkempt being on the bed. There were
curious scars on the wasted face set in its frame of wild,
tawny hair and wilder, tawnier beard. No scattering
of silver here and there, but just at the temples the hair
was white as wool. As she saw plainer now, being used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
to the dimness, the face, striking as it was, impressed her
chiefly through that quality of special ghastliness produced
by a pallor that shows clay-like under tan. “I
thought,” she said, winding up her apology—“I thought
the dog was shut up here alone—forgotten.”</p>

<p>“It might come to be like that,” he said, and paused
an instant, as if for breath. When he spoke again it
was less to his visitor than as if to soothe the ruffled
feelings of the miserable beast at his feet. “It won’t
be my fault, though,” he said. “I’ll forget most things
before I forget you, shan’t I, Ky?”</p>

<p>“That is how his master feels about this dog, too,
though <em>he’s</em> nothing but a mongrel,” Hildegarde said.
She was thinking, “The man is very ill.”</p>

<p>“His master—some one prospecting hereabouts?”</p>

<p>Briefly Hildegarde explained. As she moved toward
the door, she caught an expression on the sunken face
so arresting that straightway she said to herself: “What
is a starving dog more than a dying man, that I should
come to help the one and flee the other?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you are very ill.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered quietly.</p>

<p>“There’s someone at the settlement who looks after you?”</p>

<p>He smiled faintly. “They’ve given me up as a bad
investment.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” broke from the girl’s lips, as she leaned forward
and then caught herself up. Was the hermit not
dead after all! Was she face to face at last with the discoverer
of the Mother Lode? If so, she mustn’t seem to
know. “Isn’t there any doctor here?” she added hurriedly.</p>

<p>“There’s a fellow they <em>call</em> ‘doctor.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then let me go for him.”</p>

<p>“He’s off prospecting.”</p>

<p>“When will he be back?”</p>

<p>“After I’m gone, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are leaving here?” and the moment she said
it she felt the cruelty of the question.</p>

<p>But he only answered “Yes,” and left her to miss or
to divine his meaning. Looking in his face she forgot
his character of hermit, and fell to wondering whom he
had in the world to care about his leaving it. Instinctively
she knew that a man with such a spirit looking
out of eyes like those—for a man like this to die, meant
to some one far away the worst that could befall. And
suddenly she felt that she was enviable, being there, if
in some way she could help him. What was there she
might do?</p>

<p>He glanced at the foot of the bed, where the old dog
lay at his feet. “When did you say you were going back
to your ship?”</p>

<p>“Not for an hour or so,” she said. “More than long
enough for me to—when did you eat last?”</p>

<p>“If you’d give me a little water,” he spoke huskily.</p>

<p>She went to a zinc bucket that stood in the corner.
“I’m afraid this isn’t fresh,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes. An old fellow brought it only an hour ago.
There’s the cup.”</p>

<p>She followed his eyes to a rusty condensed-milk can,
which she filled and rinsed, saying cheerfully: “Then
some one <em>does</em> look after you?”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t after me the old scoundrel looks.” With
great eyes darkening, he lowered his voice: “Is he hanging
about still? A sort of tramp with—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, the man I think you mean has gone out to the
gulch.”</p>

<p>“H’m! Tired of waiting! We saw that in his face
when he brought in the water, didn’t we, Ky?” The
dog raised her head. “Yes, he wasn’t anything like as
afraid of you, Ky, as he used to be. Time’s short.” He
pulled himself up and fell to work with a knife upon
the piece of wood that lay on the gray blanket.</p>

<p>Suspiciousness has made him brain-sick, thought the
girl. She dried the dripping can on her handkerchief
as she looked over at the dog. “Poor Ky. What happened
to her eye?”</p>

<p>“Left it up yonder.” He glanced through the open
door to the white surf curling up above the tundra, and
with his wild head he made a little motion to the north.
But not even long enough to drink did he stop his feverish
whittling. As she put the cup on a tin cracker-box,
set within his reach, she saw there was a little heap of
shavings and splinters in the hollow of the blanket between
the man’s gaunt knees, and she noticed that he
held his knife with grotesque awkwardness. Then, with
an inward shrinking, saw that to every finger but two,
the final joint or more was lacking. “How dreadfully
you’ve been hurt.”</p>

<p>He looked up and then followed the direction of her
glance. “Yes, I got a good deal mauled”—only half-articulate
the iterated burden—“up yonder.”</p>

<p>His voice made her heart ache for pity of such utter
weakness. The task he had set himself looked as painful
as impossible. Yet remembering the solace whittling
seems to be to certain backwoodsmen: “Do you do that
for amusement?” she asked diffidently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<p>“If that’s what it is, I shan’t lack entertainment.”</p>

<p>She looked wonderingly in his face.</p>

<p>“I was weeks before cutting up a little wood. But
somebody stole it. Scarcer than gold up here.”</p>

<p>Oh, yes, the discoverer of the Mother Lode had stores
of the precious metal hidden away somewhere. The
skulker among the rocks—<em>he</em> knew!</p>

<p>“Let me help.” She went closer with outstretched
hand. But he started and dropped the clumsily held
wood. It all happened in an instant. Hildegarde, following
the look on the wild face he was bending down,
saw that his concern was not for the precious and sole
piece of timber in the hut, but for the oilskin bundle
under the bed, which her dog was in the act of investigating.
The half-blind beast on the blanket saw, too.
She made one bound and fell upon Hildegarde’s companion
with a fury that filled the narrow space with
noise of battle. The sick man called off his dog, while
Hildegarde reviled hers and tugged at his collar.</p>

<p>When peace was again restored, “I must take him
away,” said his mistress. “He’s behaving very badly.”</p>

<p>“No, it will be all right if I—” The sick man leaned
still further over the side of the narrow bed, and fastened
the hand Hildegarde couldn’t bear to look at under the
knotted oilskin.</p>

<p>As she saw him feebly straining to lift it: “Oh, let
me,” she said, and bent to help him.</p>

<p>Again his dog flew to the rescue, while the man himself,
with a desperate final effort, almost snatched the
bundle from under her fingers. “I—I beg your pardon,”
he said panting, and again he made his dog lie
down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<p>But Hildegarde’s feelings were a little hurt. The
normal miner, she had always understood, showed people
his gold—even trusted them to handle it.</p>

<p>“Poor old Ky,” the sick man went on apologetically;
“she has got so used to guarding this”—he was himself
positively hugging the unsavory bundle—“she can’t see
any other creature come near it without—”</p>

<p>“You’re quite as bad,” Hildegarde said to herself,
but a glance at the face, with the look of doom in the
eyes, made her set down his excitement, and the failure
in fairly judging her, to the darkening of all things in
the gathering shadow.</p>

<p>“I suppose you think I have something very valuable
here?” he said, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be the first time in Alaska that something
valuable has been wrapped in rags and left lying
in a corner.”</p>

<p>“Something like what I’ve got here?” he asked, as
he took tighter hold on the oilskin.</p>

<p>He should not think she was curious about his gold
dust and his nuggets. She looked at Ky climbing with
difficulty back to her place at the foot of the bed, and
pointedly changed the subject. “Your dog is very
lame.”</p>

<p>He nodded. “Got one of her paws crushed.”</p>

<p>To distract him from his brain-sick anxiety about the
bundle, “How was that?” Hildegarde asked. No answer
this time, only that same northward motion. “She
must be very old,” Hildegarde pursued.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Your dog, I mean. Surely she is old.”</p>

<p>“No. She got like that—up—”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;" id="illus10">
<img src="images/illus10.jpg" width="450" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“‘I suppose you think I have something very valuable here?’”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span></p>

<p>He still clutched the oilskin with such anxious hands
that Hildegarde felt it mere humanity to win him to
forget his fears. So she looked away from the gaunt
figure, over the threshold and over the surf to where the
white sails of the <i>Beluga</i> shone.</p>

<p>“I’ve been ‘up yonder,’ too,” she said.</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em>”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve seen the North Siberian shore quite plain.
I’ve been as far as the Bering Straits.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the Bering Straits!” he echoed, as one inwardly
amused at a traveler who should boast of getting as far
as the adjoining county.</p>

<p>“Yes, and—and I’d like to go further still.”</p>

<p>“Better not—better not.”</p>

<p>“But, of course, I would!” She put her hand in the
pocket of her long cloak and drew out the “latest map”
of extreme northwestern Alaska. “I’m like the rest.
The more I see up here, the more I want to see.” She
sat down on the earthen floor just inside the threshold,
and spread out the yard square tinted paper. As she
bent over it, “What part of the map lures you most?”
she asked, wandering if she would hear where was the
home of this curious being dying up here alone.</p>

<p>As he did not answer at once, she looked up, laying
her hand on the paper and saying, “This for me.”</p>

<p>She saw him take surer hold on the packet he was
guarding, and he leaned across it to see precisely what
portion of the earth’s surface her hand was covering.</p>

<p>“You want to know the name of the most interesting
country in the world?” she asked smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you say?” He seemed to humor her.</p>

<p>“The name of the most interesting country on the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
of the globe is under my hand.” She lifted it. He
peered down. She pushed the rustling paper across the
uneven floor, till leaning over he could read, in big black
letters, the word “UNEXPLORED.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he said softly, with as great a light in his face
as if those letters had indeed spelled home. “<em>You</em> feel
that? I didn’t know that women—” He broke off, and
absently took a fresh hold on the bundle, as though
anticipating some adroit attempt upon his treasure.</p>

<p>His foolishness about that packet had got upon Hildegarde’s
nerves. “People who don’t know them think
Chinamen are all alike. Men who know little of women
think the same of us.”</p>

<p>He smiled. “Do you mean you realize how precious
those blank spaces are?” Again he craned weakly over
the bundle and stared down at the map. The thought
again occurred to her that his look was like the look
a wanderer turns home. Wondering about him she hardly
listened to the words he was saying, how the kingdom
of the unknown shrinks and shrinks and soon shall
vanish from the maps—worse still, own no dominion
any more over the minds of men.</p>

<p>Whether he was indulging some fantasy of fever
she could not tell, but the scarred face wore a look so
high and sorrowful that she found herself saying,
“Surely the only value of the empty space is that some
man may one day set a name there.”</p>

<p>He threw her a pitying look. And he stroked the
oilskin as a child might caress a kitten.</p>

<p>“I see,” she said, trying in self-defense to be a little
superior, “<em>you</em> don’t, after all, sympathize with the explorer
spirit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p>At which the strange eyes rewarded her with sudden
smiling. “If you mean you do,” he said, “think for a
moment what a power the unknown has been in history.
Think what it’s done for people—a mere empty space
upon the map—”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she threw in, “it has made heroes.”</p>

<p>“It has made men.” But for all the restrained quietness
of tone his look evoked a glorious company.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she agreed. “It made Columbus, and it made
Cortez. It made Magellan, Drake, and Cook, Livingstone
and—”</p>

<p>“And all the millions more,” he interrupted, still on
that quiet note, “who only planned or dreamed.” But
while he spoke his maimed fingers wandered over the
oilskin—a brain-sick miser guarding his gold. And
though she listened to what he said, her eyes, against her
will, kept surreptitiously revisiting the uncouth bundle
he was fondling with abhorrent hands.</p>

<p>“I feel like a son of that land”—one hand left the
bundle an instant and pointed down at the map—“<em>The
Unexplored</em>. Like a man who sees his mother country
filched from him bit by bit, parceled out and brought
under subjection. Yes”—he raised his voice suddenly
to such a note as set the girl’s nerves unaccountably to
thrilling—“yes, I resent the partition of that empire.
It is the oldest on the earth. I am glad I shall not see
its passing.” He leaned back, and a grayness gathered
on his face as he ended: “Many a man will be without
a country, many a soul will be homeless when the last
province of that kingdom yields.”</p>

<p>She only nodded, but he suddenly began afresh, as
though she had contributed something convincing. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
have never talked of these things to a woman, but since
you seem to feel the significance of—” He broke off,
and then slowly, “It might be you could help me,” he
said.</p>

<p>“How could I—”</p>

<p>Still clinging feverishly to the knotted oilskin, he
dragged himself with difficulty to an upright posture
and craned forward to stare through the open door.
Not this time northward solely, but down the beach as
well as up.</p>

<p>“What are you looking for?” asked the girl.</p>

<p>As he sat there huddled, silent, she became conscious
that he was listening—listening with that sort of strained
intentness that almost creates sound, does create it to the
sense accessible to hypnotic influence.</p>

<p>“Who is that outside?” he said very low.</p>

<p>“No one,” she answered, though it seemed to her, too,
there must be some one there.</p>

<p>“Look out and see.”</p>

<p>As she got up to obey him, “But you won’t go away,”
he said suddenly.</p>

<p>“No, only as far as—”</p>

<p>“Don’t go out of sight!” There was an excitement in
his voice that gave her a moment’s fear of him. Out of
the dank little hut his voice followed her into the sunshine:
“Is he there again?”</p>

<p>“No one,” she answered, “no one at all! Except—”</p>

<p>To the south, on the edge of the tiny settlement, a
group of Esquimaux. It must have been their voices his
quick ear had caught now and then above the surf.</p>

<p>Northward, up the curving beach, two men calking a
boat. But though they stood out vivid in that wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
light, Hildegarde knew they must be half a mile away;
and so she told him.</p>

<p>“Is that all?”</p>

<p>Nothing more. Not a creature on the treeless hill
rising behind the hovel. In front of where the girl
stood no soul nearer than where the bark <i>Beluga</i> set her
transfigured sails against the western limit of the world.
Between her and that sole link with her own life, only
the long barrier of the battling surf. From within, the
feeble voice saying indistinguishable words that yet conveyed
some feverish purpose. A sudden temptation
seized the girl to call her dog and run.</p>

<p>“You are sure”—the weak voice came to meet her as
she turned back—“sure there isn’t an old man about—fellow
with a hungry face and a long, lank beard?”</p>

<p>“And an hour-glass and a scythe,” she filled out the
picture to herself. Yes. One like that is lurking here at
the door, and no man can bar him out and none refuse
to follow at his call. But aloud, “No one,” she said.</p>

<p>“Then come in and shut the door.” And again she
thought of flight, and again put the impulse by. But
she said if the door were shut she must go, and made her
excuse the need to keep an eye out for her friend. Then
she sat down as before, where she could command the
beach.</p>

<p>The sick man was obviously ill-pleased and not a little
scornful. “You will understand why I don’t want to be
overheard when I tell you—” Again he sent the searching
glance into that square of the world the driftwood
lintel framed, and his voice was half a whisper.
“You’ll understand when I tell you I have a legacy to
leave.” He waited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>“How did you know!” he demanded, and the eyes
were less friendly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t <em>know</em>.”</p>

<p>“You suspected—”</p>

<p>“Well, most people, however poor, have something to
leave, however little.”</p>

<p>He lifted his hand to silence the platitude, and his
whisper reached her clear and sharp: “I am leaving
more than ever a man left before.”</p>

<p>It was true then about the Mother Lode. She
waited, hardly breathing. He had said she could
help him. He wanted a letter written or witness
to a will, but he had fallen back upon that
strained listening. “You have children?” Hildegarde
asked.</p>

<p>He made a barely perceptible motion, no.</p>

<p>“Brothers and sisters?” She tried to help his memory.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Who, then?”</p>

<p>“My legacy’s too great to leave to any individual.”
Hildegarde’s eyes kindled with excitement. All the
talk about Nome had given her a sense of living in an
atmosphere of mighty enterprise, of giant losses, and of
fabulous gain. She was primed to hear of lucky millions
stumbled on by chance.</p>

<p>“You want to make a bequest to the nation?” Why
was he hesitating, she wondered impatiently, as he flung
again that same intent look out of doors? She knew he
could see nothing but the wild, white horses climbing the
rocky shore to look across the tundra. She knew he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
hear nothing but the thunder of their hoof-beats on the
beach.</p>

<p>At last he spoke. “They said my trouble was ambition.”
And still his ears waited for some sound beyond
Hildegarde’s hearing, and still his eyes saw more than
hers.</p>

<p>He was silent so long she adventured in the dark, “Did
you leave ambition ‘up yonder,’ too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, up yonder!” But he brought out the words
triumphantly, and he paused upon a broken breath still
listening. “Ky,” he whispered, “the lady likes exploring,
but she’s afraid to shut the door. Go out, Ky, and
see if that old villain’s hanging about. <em>Ky!</em>”</p>

<p>The beast took her nose out of the blanket, and seemed
to implore him to reconsider his command.</p>

<p>“Go out and explore! Go—<em>once more</em>!” There was
a curious gentle note in the weak voice.</p>

<p>“Don’t send her out,” Hildegarde pleaded. “My
dog’s out there now. Poor Ky.” She was conscious
that her kindness for the maimed beast pleased the
owner.</p>

<p>“Have you ever cared about a dog?” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, if I haven’t, I know some one who has, and
that’s Red’s master. Why do you ask me?”</p>

<p>“Because I find myself with all my wealth wanting
two things at the last.”</p>

<p>“What things?”</p>

<p>“A little fire that I haven’t strength to make, and a
friend for Ky.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help you about the fire.” She reached out and
picked up the fallen pieces of wood.</p>

<p>While she was opening her knife, “I believe,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
“yes, I believe you would help me about Ky—if you
knew.”</p>

<p>“Help you, how?”</p>

<p>He fastened his eyes on the girl’s face. “Ky is one
of us,” he said very low.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Only she is better at the game.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde leaned nearer to catch the husky words.
“No one who ever braved the North, no one who ever
grappled with the ice, not one of them all has done it
more courageously than Ky.” The shadow-ringed eyes
sought the girl’s again. “Nobody could be quite indifferent
to Ky who cared about—who—” He broke off,
exhausted by his fruitless effort to sit upright. He
dropped forward on his elbows and rested his bearded
chin in his hands. The tawny tide poured in streams
through his fingers, and hid the horror of them. “To-morrow,”
he said, with his eyes on Hildegarde, “to-morrow
Ky will be the sole survivor of the only expedition
that ever reached the Pole.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-s.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Silent the girl sat there. But senses less
alert than the hermit’s would have felt the
passion of wonder that held her motionless.
For all the world of difference between these
two, the same light was shining in each face.</p>

<p>“How does the time go?” He made a movement toward
his pocket, and then dropped his hand. “Curious
how I still forget—I left it—” Again the motion.
“Will you put your watch where I can see it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, go on; go on!” she urged. “My companion
won’t go back without me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have plenty of time. But for me there’ll
be barely enough,” and the face that he turned an instant
toward the ship— Oh, beyond doubting, his time
was short!</p>

<p>Out of her cow-boy hat she drew a long pin, and going
to the foot of the bed she thrust the hatpin several inches
into the peat wall above where the dog lay. But her near
presence was so resented by the great explorer, Ky, that
before the watch could be hung upon the pin, Hildegarde
must needs retreat. She remembered the luncheon in
her pocket, and offered Ky a share. No; Ky wanted
nothing of a stranger.</p>

<p>“Throw it down by the door,” said her master, and it
was done. When Hildegarde had retired, the dog came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
down, and when he turned his blind eye about again, lo,
a shining thing upon the wall.</p>

<p>“So!” the sick man sank back satisfied. “Now to get
you to help me about Ky, I must put twenty years into
an hour. More than twenty, for I can’t remember when
I began to think about finding the Pole. I played at it
all my boyhood. I’ve worked at it ever since.” An instant
Hildegarde dropped her shrinking eyes. For he
was putting out that maimed hand for the cup. She
heard the grate of rusty tin on the cracker-box, as his
cleared voice went on, “I began by going in a revenue
cutter to Port Barrow; and I had been in two arctic
expeditions before the one I’m telling you about. But
on both of those others I was the one man who wasn’t
going for the Pole. I was going for experience. I never
believed my chiefs would get there, but I always believed
I would—later. I had theories.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish you had known a friend of ours—”</p>

<p>“I had a friend of my own. The year after I got back
from the second voyage, I met one night, at a club in
New York, a young Russian-American who was nearly
as keen about polar problems as I was. We talked arctic
exploration all that winter of ’95 and ’96. We both
believed tremendously in Nansen.”</p>

<p>“So did he—<em>our</em> friend.”</p>

<p>“We agreed we’d have given ten years of life to have
had the honor of going along with the Norwegian. But
he had been away now nearly three years. How far had
he got? What had happened? Even experts began to
say: ‘Another expedition crushed in the arctic ice.’ But
neither my Russian nor I believed that Nansen was dead,
and we began privately to discuss a rescue-party. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
agreed that if we carried out our idea, and if we found
Nansen unsuccessful, we’d offer him our ship to come
home in and <em>we</em>—we’d push straight on. Ours
shouldn’t be any trumpeted ‘dash for the Pole’—how we
loathed the cheap gallantry of the phrase!” The voice
that had flared up an instant fell again as he said: “We
knew something, even then, of the snail’s pace of that
laboring on; that doing battle for every yard; that nightmare
of crawling forward inch by inch—only so, we
knew, might a man make his ‘dash for the Pole.’ But
the plan of setting off without saying to any one what it
was we were hoping to do supplied my Russian and me
with our first condition for making the attempt.”</p>

<p>Was it indeed only water in the cup, that after another
draught of it he should seem to throw off weakness
as you might a burdensome cloak? “My friend had
money, so had I. No need of a public appeal. No need
to beat the big drum and talk tall. Both of us had felt
the irony of each explorer’s coming back to assure the
world that he had never meant to find the Pole. What
he had gone for was exploration of the ice-fields this
side. Ha! Ha!” It was strange that such a feeble little
laugh could give out such a world of irony. “Or else,
what he’d gone for was to ascertain the salinity of the
polar seas, or to determine the trend of arctic currents.
Or to explain”—again that hardly audible laughter—“how
the <i>Jeanette’s</i> oilskin breeches got to the Greenland
coast; anything under heaven, except reaching the
paltry Pole. So as we knew we were made of no better
stuff, if as good, as our predecessors, we said that we,
too, if we came back with only some deep sea dredgings,
a few photographs of ice-pressure effects—sketches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
Aurora Borealis, and a store of polar bearskins and
walrus tusks, we, too, would find ourselves pointing to
these as the treasures we’d staked life and reputation
for. So hard it is to suffer the extremity and still have
to say ‘I failed’!”</p>

<p>He lay silent so long that Hildegarde quoted Cheviot.
“They say it’s harder for an American.”</p>

<p>“What is?”</p>

<p>“To accept defeat. Harder for us than for the
others.”</p>

<p>“Why do they say that?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard it’s because we make such a fetish of
success.” Still he lay there silent. It was as if the oil
in the lamp had failed. “Yes, yours was a good plan,”
she said. “Even those others, the Old-World people,
that they say are soberer than we—” She saw that he
turned his hollow eyes toward her, listening. “If
even they made excuses, and shirked saying they’d
failed—yours was the best— Oh, it was a splendid
plan!”</p>

<p>“Are you saying we’re a nation of boasters?”</p>

<p>Good! that had roused him. “Do you say we are
not?”</p>

<p>“We are everything under the sun: most vain and
braggart; most discreet and self-effacing; most childish
and obvious; most subtle and complex. The extreme of
anything, good or evil, that’s the American.” His eyes
found out the tiny watch face on the peat wall. Ah, that
was the tonic that was acting like a cordial mixed with
magic. Right or wrong, he was under the dominion of
a terror that this last flickering up of energy would fail
before he had turned it to account. Even to remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
that small shining disk seemed to nerve him anew. Each
look a lash. It whipped him on.</p>

<p>“As I’ve said, my Tatar and I laid our heads together
and agreed. ‘For fear we fall into the old snare,
we won’t say we’re going at all,’ not even to find Nansen,
for fear we should promise too much. We would
make the great attempt under the guise of a whaling
expedition. My Russian had already sent out two, and
had once gone along with one of them. I had spent a
winter with the Samoyedes.”</p>

<p>“What! <em>You</em> did that?” His eyes, though not his
mind, took in the girl’s breathless agitation. He paused,
but his thoughts were too far away. “I thought only
one man had ever—” began the girl trembling, and then:
“Go on; go on!”</p>

<p>“We were both still young. Yes, six years ago I was
young; and hard as a husky. But not so hard as a man
need be who goes exploring in the mild climate of the
drawing-room.”</p>

<p>Hildegarde bent toward him, with wildly beating
heart.</p>

<p>“We were just on the point of chartering our ship,
when one evening—” He looked through the peat wall
a thousand leagues.</p>

<p>“One evening—what?”</p>

<p>“I saw a face. A girl’s soft face, but it cut the cables
of my ship and set her afloat—drifting, derelict, for all
I cared. A little doll’s face. But it shut out everything
else under the skies!”</p>

<p>Oh, Bella, Bella, was it yours—that face? “Go on,”
breathed the girl at the door.</p>

<p>“When her people said she should never marry a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
who might any day go off on one of these protracted
voyages, I looked at the face, and I said I would never
explore again.” The glazed eyes turned to Hildegarde,
but it was the old bright vision they saw, not this newer,
softer presence, with wet cheeks, by the door.</p>

<p>“I told my Russian to draw on me for half the funds,
and to find another fellow-traveler. But she was too
young to marry, they said. We must wait a year. I
said I would wait. When the year was half gone, I was
in London—because the face was there.” Still looking
through the wall he groped for the cup. Hildegarde
rose, and put it in his hands. Oh poor, poor hands! No
need to turn shuddering away. They were softly
wrapped from her sight in a mist of pitiful tears.</p>

<p>He gave her back the cup. “We had been to a skating
party,” he said. Something grotesque conjured by
the contrast of that light phrase wafted out of a butterfly
world to fall in such a place at such an hour made for
the unreality, not of far-off London, nor of parties
where pretty ladies play at being in a world of ice—the
conjuration merely lifted the dim hut and its wild
occupant into the realm of the phantasmagoric. The
girl saw all in a wavering dimness, shot dazzlingly with
splinters of sunshine. But the man went on in that
level tone: “I remember her saying it was the first party
given in London on artificial ice—an absurd affair. But
she said: ‘Wasn’t it nice of me to get you an invitation,
too? It will seem quite like going to your horrid
North Pole.’”</p>

<p>How plain Bella’s voice sounded in the room. That
was why he was smiling. Bella could always bring that
look into the eyes of men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>

<p>“I said, ‘quite like the North Pole.’ And I went and
skated with her. Afterward, at the door, I had just
seen her and her mother into the carriage, when my eye
fell on the orange-colored bill of the ‘Pall Mall Gazette.’
And three words printed there blared out like
trumpets.</p>

<p class="center">‘NEWS FROM NANSEN.’</p>

<p>‘He’s found it!’ I said to myself—‘Nansen’s found
the Pole!’ and I could have flung up my hat and cried
hurrah in the sober street. As I called to the newsboy
I was ashamed of my voice. I thought people would
notice how it shook. When I pulled my hand out of my
pocket it trembled so I dropped the coin and it rolled
away into the street. The boy ran after it, and I damned
him for his pains. ‘Never mind! Give me a paper!’ I
called out. But the boy ran on. As I stood there waiting
for him to disentangle himself from the traffic and
come back, I seemed to live a lifetime. How had he
done it, that splendid fellow, Nansen? What had it
been like? Well, soon I should know. The knowledge
that had cost so much, soon I should have it in my hand—for
a penny! The awful majesty of the upper regions
fell away.”</p>

<p>With a growing excitement painfully the sick man
lifted himself up. “It was then,” he said, “then—a
queer thing happened.” He seemed to wait for something.
Turning to the girl, “You see, this was the
moment I’d been living for in a way.”</p>

<p>“Of course; of course.”</p>

<p>“And yet, now that it had come, my spirit had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
down like the sounding lead on a deep-sea bottom. I
stood there in the street with a sense of unmitigable loss.
Something so sudden and acute that I didn’t myself
understand at first what was going on in me. For it
was something quite apart from any feeling that I’d
like to have been the one to do the thing. There had
been for months no question of that. No. It was just
a poignant realization that almost the last of the jealous
old world’s secrets had been forced out of her keeping.
This thing that men had dreamed about before ever
they’d girdled the globe—it was no more the stuff of
dreams. The thought of Captain Cook and Franklin
flashed across my mind, and I remembered the men of
the <i>Jeanette</i>. But it wasn’t till I remembered the men
unborn that I measured the full extent of the disaster.
The generations to come would never know what it had
stood for—this goal the Norwegian had won. They
wouldn’t have to spend even a penny to hear all about
it. It would be thrust at them, this shining and terrible
thing men had died to gain—one leaden fact the
more, conned in a heavy book, stripped to the lean
dimensions of a date! Discovery of America, discovery
of the Pole—who thrills over these things when they
are done? And now the newsboy was coming slowly
back, rubbing the mud off my half-crown. In a second
I should be reading how the last great stronghold of
wonder was destroyed. ‘Well, the world’s grown
poorer!’ I said to myself, and I counted my change,
thinking less of Nansen’s news than of those men of the
future. He had taken from them the finest playground
ever found for the imagination—the last great field for
grim adventuring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>

<p>“I opened the paper and read that Nansen had turned
back before reaching the eighty-seventh parallel.</p>

<p>“The Pole was still to be found.”</p>

<p class="tb">Ah, Bella, when you saw that look go traveling so far,
so far, you must have known that he would follow. Poor
little Bella!</p>

<p>Under those vision-filled eyes, the crippled dog, still
sleeping, made a muffled sound. “Ky is dreaming,”
said the sick man, absently, “that she hears a seal crying
‘Ho-o-o,’ with his nose above the ice. Or she thinks
she hears the ‘Kah! kah! sah! sah!’ of the auks. So do
I, sometimes.”</p>

<p>“But you promised ‘the face’ you wouldn’t think of
the arctic any more.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” and weakness of the flesh or weight of memory
held him a moment silent. “She always said that if the
Norwegian had been successful she and I would never
have quarreled. She wrote that in every letter after I
left her. I don’t know. She was very young. She never
understood”—he glanced at Hildegarde—“never understood
what was the most interesting place on the map.
She thought it was Paris.” He smiled. “Maybe she
was right. I don’t know. All I do know is”—and a
subtle animation invaded voice and air—“a few weeks
after I read Nansen’s news in the London street, Borisoff
came across from Christiana to talk things over. All
this time that I had been looking at the face he had been
building a ship as good, he said, as the <i>Fram</i>. No man
would dare say more. He had made agreements with
a crew and company of picked men, some of them his
old whaling people. He had news that the Finlander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
we’d sent the year before to Siberia, after Olenek dogs,
would be waiting with the pack up there on that bleak
shore, between Chelyuskin and the Kara Sea—‘waiting
for you and me,’ said Borisoff.” The sick man’s eyes
were shining. “Borisoff was a tremendous fellow! I
never knew but one person who didn’t believe in
Borisoff. You couldn’t expect a girl—” he broke off.
“But the great bond between him and me was that we
both had that passion for the North, that is like nothing
else on earth in the way of land love. Talk of the
South! A man loves the South as he loves a soft bed and
the warm corner by the fire. But he loves the North as
he loves his prey.” He brought one hand away from his
beard and he fastened it afresh in the knotted oilskin at
his side, with an air of one about to rise up and continue
his journey. “Well, one day I said to Borisoff, ‘Of
course <em>we</em> can’t do the damned thing if Nansen couldn’t—so
come along, and let’s try!’</p>

<p>“We sailed from Tromsö that July.</p>

<p>“But we didn’t call ourselves arctic explorers, and
we never once said Pole—not even after we reached the
edge of the ice-pack, north of Sannikof Island. It
wasn’t till we got into north latitude 78° that we called
a council of war. By that time we knew our men and
they knew us. We were sure of six, but we put it to the
other four as well. We engaged to extricate the ship
from the floe and send her home, if any man of them
wanted to turn back. What were Borisoff and I going
to do? one of the doubtful four asked. Well, we had our
famous steel launch, and we had sledges, dogs, kyacks,
provisions, and—we had—an idea we’d like to see what
it was like—<em>farther on</em>. I’ve always believed our not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
saying anything about ‘a dash,’ or so much as naming the
great goal, gave Borisoff’s words their most compelling
eloquence. If we’d said then that we wanted to try for
the Pole, some one would have felt himself obliged to
object and talk prudence. As it was, we twelve sat there
as one man in the little saloon of the <i>Narwhal</i>, with the
loose ice grinding against the ship’s sides. And no one
said, but every one was thinking, ‘We’ll find the Pole.’
Borisoff was a born leader. Not a soul on the ship but
believed Borisoff would do anything he set out to do.
They all knew by now how extraordinarily well equipped
we were. Borisoff showed again and again how we
should profit by the failure of our forerunners. Well,
that was in September. We were frozen in, and we
drifted with the ice all that winter and following summer—drifted
in the dark, with bears prowling round the
ice-shrouded ship—drifted in the midnight sun with
guillemots and fulmars circling about our rigging.”</p>

<p>He sat there some seconds staring through the peat
wall, never seeing the open watch, forgetting the irrevocable
hour. As though she, too, shared in some chill
vision, the dog shivered.</p>

<p>To bring the master back, “Ky is cold,” said Hildegarde,
and would have thrown over her a trailing end of
blanket.</p>

<p>“No, no, she’s not cold <em>here</em>,” the sick man answered,
but in a voice so faint and far Hildegarde wondered if
he would ever speak again.</p>

<p>To mask her creeping fear and bridge the silence,
“Why does she shiver, if she’s not cold?”</p>

<p>His absent eyes came slowly back to where the dog
was uneasily dozing. “Thinks we’re crossing the ice-moraines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
thinks she can’t go on, then remembers the
whip. The whip that flies out when you least expect it,
eh, Ky?—and bites the hair off clean.” He bent forward,
and gently laid his distorted hands on the scarred
and trembling hide. The dog was quiet again.</p>

<p>“That first winter,” he went on, “one of our men was
killed by a bear, and one died from a natural cause. He
would have died at home. Early in the summer came
the day when the ice gripped us. Our tough ship might
have been an egg-shell. But we were ready.”</p>

<p>“You had to abandon her?”</p>

<p>He gave a short nod. “Sledges out on the ice away
from the pressure area, packed, and kyack-loaded. We
had kept the dogs in condition by short journeys, and
we knew they were as splendid animals for work as they
were terrible for fighting. We couldn’t prevent them
from tearing each other to pieces, but between whiles
they carried us on. Eh, Ky? You carried us on, for
you carried our means of life. Or maybe we carried you,
with our whips and clubs and curses. It’s horrible to
look back, that’s why I do it, to save Ky any more—”
His eyes implored the dumb creature’s pardon. “Those
days and months of forcing the dwindled pack over the
pressure ridges!—and when the patient beasts stopped
from sheer exhaustion, shouting at them till our own
voices tore our nerves and burst our very ear-drums,
hardening our hearts, beating the splendid animals, till
they lay down one by one on those desolate ice-plains
and died. Well, well, well,”—he made sure of the bundle
again,—“the dogs had the best of it. <em>We</em> blood-marked
many a mile of the polar ice, we stumbled
from floe to floe, we stormed the pressure ridges, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
when the teams had dwindled and the ice opened in long
reaches, we took the remaining dogs into our canvas
boats and along the water lanes we sailed and sailed.”</p>

<p>“To the Pole? You <em>did</em> find the—”</p>

<p>“Lord!” he interrupted, “finding the Pole isn’t a
patch on hunting for it! That’s what the men of the
future will never know. You can read the kind of thing
we went through in any arctic book. You can read it all,
and then know nothing about it. We did impossible
things—things any man will say he can’t do. And then
he does them because he must, and because human endurance
is the one miracle left in the world.”</p>

<p>An instant he stopped for breath. “Good men, all
our fellows. But their bones are up yonder. Good dogs,
too. Ky’s the one that’s left.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence in the dim little room.</p>

<p>“But you reached the Pole, Borisoff and you!”</p>

<p>Slowly he shook his wild head. “Not Borisoff.”
There was silence for a while.</p>

<p>“It must have been very horrible for you when he—”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the sick man, and Hildegarde saw the
mouth set harder yet under the tawny cloud. “The day
he died we came upon a great piece of timber frozen
aslant in the ice. Borisoff had been queer, wandering
all those last days. But that great shaft that had come
from some land where the trees grow glorious and tall,
the sight of it excited him so that it cleared his head.
He said it was Siberian spruce, and had come from his
own forests of the Yenisei. And he talked about the
currents that had carried it so far—talked rationally.
We found initials carved on one end: ‘F. N.—H.’ If
ever there had been more the record was frayed out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
existence by the timber catapulting against the ice. ‘I’ll
rest here,’ Borisoff had said, and”—a long time seemed
to go by—“I’ve no doubt he rests well. Splendid fellow,
Borisoff.</p>

<p>“The next day I cut his name on the great log, and I
went on alone.”</p>

<p>“You and Ky!”</p>

<p>He nodded. “Ky and the dogs that were left, fighting
our way over the ice-moraines in a hard, fierce light,
that seemed to come from every point of the compass at
once. I remember a curious optical delusion overtook
me. I lost all faculty of seeing the snow-covered ice I
walked on. I could feel it, of course, at every step. I
could see my snow-shoes sharp as if they’d been silhouettes
poised in air. But the terrible white light that
bathed the universe seemed to be flooding up from under
my feet as well as beating on my head. Round that
white bossed shield of the frozen sea the sun moved in
his shrunken circle, with no uprising and no setting,
abhorring shadow. Like that, day and night, night and
day.”</p>

<p>“For how long?”</p>

<p>“For a thousand years. A dog killed to feed the rest,
and still on, ‘for miles on miles on miles of desolation—leagues
on leagues on leagues, without a change.’ In a
world as dead and white as leprosy.” He closed his
eyes, as if the midnight glare still dazzled him.</p>

<p>In her sleep again the dog had been moving and
moaning.</p>

<p>“Ky is in pain,” said the girl, very softly, hardly
daring to whisper.</p>

<p>The sick man opened his eyes and faintly shook his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
head. “Only dreaming. I do the same myself. Wake
in the dark, and think the pressure has sent the ice towering
above us. And while we try to get across the
broken blocks, suddenly they begin to grind and growl
and to writhe and thunder, as if moved to hatred of us.
Ky lost a yoke-fellow in such a place, crushed between
the shrieking boulders. Quiet, Ky! The exploring’s
all done. At least”—he looked up—“I’d like to think—”</p>

<p>“You may.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the sick man.</p>

<p>“Yes, Ky,” Hildegarde spoke with a little break in
her voice. “The exploring’s all done.” As if the dog
had heard and comprehended, and so been delivered from
evil dreams, she got up, came shakily down from the bed,
and stood for a moment at the door, looking out.</p>

<p>“What’s ahead of us, Ky?” he asked, dreamily.
“An ice sky or a water sky?”</p>

<p>“How was it you could tell?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you learn. The field-ice reflection is the brightest,
a little yellow; drift ice, purer white; new ice, gray.
And where there’s open water the ‘blink’ is slatey,
isn’t it, Ky? Or blue, like the skies of California.”</p>

<p>“But the Pole?” The word brought a startled look
into his face, and his eyes guarded the threshold so
fiercely she sunk her voice to meet his humor. “What
was it like?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Ky knows,” he answered, warily. “Ky got there.”</p>

<p>With a supreme humility, or was it a high indifference
on her part, the great explorer crossed the threshold and
sat outside in the sun.</p>

<p>“I’ve wondered about it a good deal, as I’ve lain
here,” said the sick man. “It almost seems as if nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
in the world-scheme were so precious as suffering. Men
feel that when they recall their early hardships. Dimly
they see that nothing they’ve found later was of such
value to them. Yes, yes, beside, the days of the struggle
the days of the harvest are dull. And it’s this”—he
crouched over the oilskin, and dropped his voice—“this
incentive to the greatest struggle that men can embark
upon—this is the Great Legacy I shall leave behind!”</p>

<p>“But what,” she pointed to the thing he was hugging
between gaunt arms, “what is in that?”</p>

<p>“<em>The proofs</em>,” he whispered, and started when the
word was out. It seemed to Hildegarde that he held the
weather-beaten bundle tighter still, and still he put off
telling what she wanted most to know. As if he couldn’t
bring himself, after all, to yield the secret up. “Think,”
he whispered. “We could set the world ringing with it,
Ky. Only we mustn’t.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, but you must!” Hildegarde half started
to her feet.</p>

<p>“No. Not after—I swore an oath, you see.”</p>

<p>“To—”</p>

<p>That motion of the wild head: “The One up yonder.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“What One up yonder?” Hildegarde’s voice
was as hushed as his own.</p>

<p>“Kyome.”</p>

<p>“Who is that?”</p>

<p>“The god of the unknown North. Hadn’t
you heard that in all the old lands, from Greece to
Mexico, there was always an altar to the unknown god?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“When men in their foolishness threw down those
temples, the old gods fled to the farther countries. Last
of all to the world’s waste places.” He held up one
horrible hand, and made a grotesque motion of “Come
nearer.”</p>

<p>She obeyed.</p>

<p>“The greatest of these gods of the unknown—he sat
on a throne of ice at the top of the world. The others—they
had found no rest from the men of the West. Behind
the Great Wall of China we hunted them out. We
forced our way to them through Japan ports. We let
the garish day into the dim temples of Korea, and the
gold terraces of holy Lhasa are trod by alien feet. But
the uttermost North was all inviolate till I came. I
made the kingdom mine. But now”—he lifted the
maimed right hand like one taking oath—“now I abdicate.
I will destroy my title-deeds. Fire! a little fire!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
His hands fumbled among the shavings in the blanket,
and feverishly he caught up the knife.</p>

<p>“No, no. Let me,” she said. “I’ll do it for you.
See, I can split the kindling straight down.” She
strained to make good the boast. “Just a moment! Oh,
but this kind of wood is tough! What is it? Not a
piece of drift—so flat and smooth?”</p>

<p>“Piece of a broken skee—my snow-shoe.” While she
forced the sharp blade down, he was calling out, “Ky!
D’you hear that fellow laughing at us?”</p>

<p>The dog turned obedient, and both her pointed ears
seemed to be pricking at the silence.</p>

<p>“Whenever I begin to hope, I hear that walrus guffaw.”
Ky’s master was listening with all his shrinking
soul, and his eyes looked straight through the wall, but
he spoke as quietly as before. Hildegarde shivered a
little. Death itself could hardly remove him further
than he had wandered in those few seconds. “Oh, come
back!” she said in her heart, and then aloud, “Tell me,
please tell me, how I shall manage about Ky?”</p>

<p>“Ky?” His eyelids fluttered as he obeyed the call.</p>

<p>“Yes, how am I to make her follow me?”</p>

<p>“Give her more of your pilot bread.”</p>

<p>“Will she leave you at the last for that?”</p>

<p>“She won’t know it’s the last, and she is hungry.
Aren’t you, Ky?”</p>

<p>Hildegarde laid down the knife an instant, took a
fragment from her pocket and held it out to the dog.</p>

<p>Very doubtfully Ky came nearer. But still she
couldn’t make up her mind to trust the new friend’s
hand. So Hildegarde laid the coveted morsel down.</p>

<p>When Ky had cautiously snapped it up, she hobbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
to the bedside and turned her dim eyes to the old familiar
bundle.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve got it safe.” He circled it with an arm,
still looking down at the dog.</p>

<p>Would he ever let it go of his own free will? What
vain notion was this of a fire!</p>

<p>Now he was muttering absently, as he smoothed the
oilskin: “Our harvest, yours and mine. Whatever we
went through in the sowing, it was all nothing, wasn’t
it, Ky?—just nothing to bringing the harvest home.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t possible for coming to be worse than
going!”</p>

<p>“Borisoff would have said no. But Borisoff only tried
one way. <em>We</em> know—Ky and I.” In the pause the eyelids
closed over lusterless eyes. It was only while he
spoke of the journey that he seemed alive. As she
looked again at the face, as blank and cold as a grate
without a fire, horror fell upon her lest he should die
before Cheviot came back.</p>

<p>Hildegarde’s little store of splinters and shavings had
grown into a heap. “If I make kindling for the fire, I
deserve to be told—things—don’t I? Besides, then I
can tell her—the face.”</p>

<p>“How could you do that?”</p>

<p>She must break it gradually. “Wouldn’t it be possible
for me to find her out and tell her?”</p>

<p>He looked at Hildegarde dreamily an instant. “I
wonder,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it, if only you’ll go on—go on.”</p>

<p>He made a faint “no,” with the wild head, smiling
dimly. “Any one may have a nightmare. No one has
ever told a nightmare, so it didn’t sound absurd. It’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
a thing you can’t pass on, fortunately. You can’t recover
it even for yourself. Of all those last weeks, only
three things stand out clear: one was the day I saw the
first fox track in the snow.”</p>

<p>“You were glad of that?”</p>

<p>“Glad of the first sign of life?”</p>

<p>“And the second thing?”</p>

<p>“The day when I looked south and saw the sky was
yellow.”</p>

<p>“What did that mean?”</p>

<p>“Land. All the rest’s a blur. And in the blur two
shadows—Ky and I, on the homeward journey—the
journey that I knew even then wouldn’t end at home.
Ky and I. All our companions dead. The last dog,
even our infinitesimal rations of pemmican, gone.
Everything gone, but Ky and my title-deeds.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you bore it—how you kept alive.”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> don’t know. Later we fed on the small crustaceans
in the ice-channels, then the narwhal. But in the strain
I think my wits went. Mercifully I can’t recover much
in that blur of agony till the moment that stands out
clear as conflagration in the dark—that moment when
I set our course by the shadow my staff cast, and saw—”
He dropped his hollow jaw, staring at some horror unspeakable.</p>

<p>“What was it you—”</p>

<p>“I saw that while we were stumbling blindly toward
the blessed South—faster still the ice that we were on
was drifting north.”</p>

<p>“Carrying you back to—”</p>

<p>“<em>Back to the Pole.</em>”</p>

<p>Her fingers lost their hold upon the knife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span></p>

<p>He didn’t even notice that she was no longer keeping
her part of the compact. “Talk of Sisyphus! Talk of
torture! Ky and I, like half-frozen flies crawling over
the roof of the world, while the greater forces carried
us calmly back to the North! It remains burnt into my
memory as the final type of hopeless human striving.
Each day I would read the message of the shadow on
the ice, till I began to say to myself: the penalty for
having reached the Pole is that you must stay there. No
use to struggle. You are surrounded, captured, brought
back. The spirit of the violated place won’t allow a man
to carry his victory home. It was then I understood.”
Palm across palm he laid his fumbling hands, but his
faint-moving lips brought no sound forth.</p>

<p>“You prayed?”</p>

<p>“Prayed? Something of the sort. I made a vow.
By the unknown god I swore if I were allowed to get
back alive no soul should ever know—except just one
among all the living. Strange it should be you!”</p>

<p>“Of course you were thinking of little—of—”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’d tell nobody, I swore, but a girl. I meant
a girl with a little doll face—a girl who wouldn’t understand.
Our national phrase for any sort of success kept
running in my head. I still felt I’d like her to know
I hadn’t failed ‘to get there.’ Foolishness, of course.
What I really wanted was that she should have a share
in that vision no man’s eyes but mine had seen. I
meant to show her these.”</p>

<p>It was terrible to see his hands trying to undo the
treasure. But while again she hacked at the unyielding
wood, Hildegarde followed fascinated each grotesque
move the sick man made. At last the tight-drawn knots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
had yielded. Between the four corners of the ancient
oilskin, creased and twisted and stained, the harvest of
John Galbraith’s life lay open in the hollow between
his knees. Hildegarde stood up with knife caught in a
cleft of the skee, staring. He turned over the little hoard
of discolored papers that lay on a flat chart-box, a
theodolite, a pocket sextant, and a record cylinder.</p>

<p>“Notes, sketches, tables of temperature and magnetic
variation, casual phenomena. Oh, I found out strange
secrets! The whole story’s here. I’d sooner have left
my bones up yonder than not bring her back the proofs.”
He opened out the chart and hung over the grimy, tattered
sheet as though it were some work of art triumphant—a
perfection of beauty unimagined in the
world before. As he sat there hugging the shabby heap
between his knees, you would have thought that stained
and sea-soaked store must be splendid with color, or
resonant with the organ music of the deep and of great
winds harping in the waste—fit record of a pilgrimage
no soul had made before.</p>

<p>“In my heart,” he said, “I hoped, when I took her
these, she might, at last, realize—”</p>

<p>A torn and dirty book, with corners worn round and
curling, and a look about its tough, discolored pages as
though it had come down a thousand years. “My
diary.” He turned a page. “She couldn’t have read
it, wouldn’t want so much as to touch it. Still, it was
for her that even at the last I carried it rather than
food.”</p>

<p>Opening the other side of the shallow chart-box that
was fitted with grooves in which sheets of stout drawing-paper
were slipped and firmly held in place, he drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
what that first glance seemed to reveal as a meaningless
smudge of violent color. “<em>There it is!</em>” and no sooner
had he said the words, than nervously he was sheltering
the thing behind one knee. “You are sure that old fellow
isn’t hanging about?”</p>

<p>She glanced out. “Quite sure.”</p>

<p>Cautiously he brought the paper up from its moment’s
hiding, but his low voice dropped to a deeper register,
“<em>That’s what it’s like!</em>”</p>

<p>From the hoarse triumph in the tone she knew that
however clear before his actual eyes had been once this
picture in his hand, they saw it now no more.</p>

<p>“That’s what Borisoff and the rest died to have a
glimpse of. This is what I found, instead of the palæocrystic
sea. Here is where the ice-hills rise. There’d
been a storm. The low cloud-masses—they were incredible!
Like that! And the zenith clear, except for the
banners of light.”</p>

<p>Plain he had no guess that the colored crayon was
both marred and bettered; that the picture he had set
down, with some fair skill, had been less moving, less
poetic, even less true than this, that chance had wrought
with a blind but faithful artistry. For as Hildegarde
stared at the prismatic haze, a kind of wild meaning
dawned there upon the paper. Yes, surely, chance had
craftier hands than any but the greatest among the sons
of men. For the picture brought that almost religious
conviction of the truth that great art gives. Just so,
and no otherwise, must this thing have been. The dome
of the sky up yonder was an inverted bowl of brass.
And in the heavenward hollow of it a giant brood of
serpents flamed and writhed above a wild white waste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
warmed here with violet, cooled there with silver and
pearl.</p>

<p>“And that,” she said, only to have assurance of his
voice again, “that’s what the world is like up there?”</p>

<p>“Do you think men go so far, and walk through hell,
to bring home a lie?”</p>

<p>Looking no longer at the orgy of color on the paper,
but at the reflection of the actual scene in the dying
face, “It was like the Day of Judgment,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“You can see that!” The craftsman’s pleasure in his
handiwork brought out a gleam, and then, with a sudden
passion, he tore the paper across and across, while Hildegarde
cried out:</p>

<p>“Ah, don’t! Let me take it to—her!”</p>

<p>“Take it to the fire!—and leave the great legacy unencumbered.
Fire, fire!” He was gathering up the
splinters and shavings that he had whittled from the
skee in the hours before Hildegarde’s coming. “Here!
Here!”</p>

<p>A sense of impotency shackled her spirit as well as
lamed her tongue. Blindly she took the fragments over
to the embrasure of some blackened stones, just inside
and to windward of the threshold.</p>

<p>“No one is about?”</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>“This is to start it, then.” He held out something.
“This will catch easiest.”</p>

<p>“I have some thin paper here.” She twisted a wisp
of her own map of the North, with a vague instinct of
putting off an evil hour.</p>

<p>But the sick man followed with eager eyes the laying
of every crosswise stick, his gaunt frame huddled over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
his treasure while he watched the making of the sacrificial
fire that should devour it. If his eyes left Hildegarde’s
hands a moment, it was only that they might
guard the door against surprise.</p>

<p>Once again, “Look out,” he said, “and see—”</p>

<p>“There’s no one. But wouldn’t you <em>like</em> somebody
to come in? Some face out of the past—”</p>

<p>“To come <em>now</em>!”</p>

<p>“Some one who could bring you news of—that girl
you—”</p>

<p>“Remember wood’s worth more than gold up here!
Keep a little back.”</p>

<p>“Keep some back?”</p>

<p>“Paper like this burns slow. As you say some one
might interrupt—” No hospitality in the look he sent
to the door. “Before you light it, have everything over
there, ready to feed the fire.” His thin arms gathered
up the store. Ky growled uneasily as Hildegarde drew
near, the girl wondering what was best for Galbraith’s
peace, what was of any avail.</p>

<p>He made a motion to give her all he held, but what
he actually handed over was the torn crayon, and even
in the act of giving up that he set one fragment against
another, looking his last.</p>

<p>“Oh, keep it—let me keep it—for her. Could you
bear to hear—”</p>

<p>But that mysterious arctic current, about which the
greatest geographers are not agreed, it had carried him
back again to the Pole! With vacant eyes on the colored
paper, “We left him a feather for his ice-cap,
didn’t we, Ky?”</p>

<p>“A feather.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<p>“Or a ribbon. Didn’t you see?”</p>

<p>“See—?”</p>

<p>“This. You didn’t notice we planted the stars and
stripes there?”</p>

<p>“Oh-h. You see I thought you said no one was ever
to know—”</p>

<p>“—and I carved a B. on the flagstaff. It was Borisoff’s
snow-shoe staff. But the B.—it didn’t stand for
Borisoff.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“No. The bamboo stood up there so light and slender—”
Again the look that only one remembrance could
bring into his eyes.</p>

<p>“It must have seemed like Bella upholding our country’s
flag.”</p>

<p>His whole face warmed into smiling. The death
shadows fled for that moment of his saying, “Had I
told you her name? Yes, I brought the record cylinder
away, and left there only something that would perish.”</p>

<p>“You make a fetish of that oath you swore!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t because of the oath. Why should I take an
empty fame out of the world with me? Should I rest the
better?”</p>

<p>“You think only of yourself. But there’s the gain to
science. What right have you to deprive the world of
that?”</p>

<p>He smiled. “You speak like a green girl, or like a
newspaper. Forgive me! But you don’t realize. The
gain to science is the by-product. The true gain is to
the human soul. You don’t believe me? Read the most
inspiring books ever written about the arctic.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I have. Who wrote them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span></p>

<p>“Franklin, Greely, and De Long—the three who
failed. Here’s to them!” He lifted up the cup,
emptied it, and dropped it with a ringing of rusty tin,
an eye cleared and preternaturally bright. “In the past
it was all different, you know. Enough and to spare in
the physical world to be conquered. But the things to
be conquered in the future, do you know what they
are?”</p>

<p>Voiceless she shook her head.</p>

<p>“Moral weakness and physical self-indulgence. In
America we are all so comfortable we are all like to be
damned!”</p>

<p>She could have wept aloud to hear the half-whimsical,
half-delirious tone of the wreck upon the camp-bed
deprecating comfort.</p>

<p>“If Borisoff had lived—I don’t know. But Borisoff
is sleeping in the lee of that great shaft of Siberian pine,
and I—if I know anything in the hereafter, I shall be
glad that I left the hope behind me for other men.”</p>

<p>“Left it for some new Norse Viking maybe, or some
sea-faring Briton. And America will never know—”</p>

<p>“’Sh. I’m not sure whether I’m more sorry that
America shouldn’t know she was first at the goal, or
whether I’m not more proud that it should be an American
who wins the race and refrains from making the
world resound with it. That it should be an American,
after all, to do just that. One, too,”—he smiled with a
curious sweetness,—“one as guilty of boasting as his
brothers are. So you see I keep some spark of vanity to
light me—out. Here!” He gathered the hoard in his
arms an instant, and held it half-hidden under his
beard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span></p>

<p>But it seemed as hard for him to loose his arms from
about his treasure as for a mother to part from her child.</p>

<p>Hildegarde made a tender, half-unconscious motion of
protecting both the broken man and the toys his dying
hands still clung to. But he, not comprehending, said
faintly: “I’ve carried this little bundle of papers across
the crown of the world to—to give it to a strange woman
at last!”</p>

<p>“No, no.” She fell on her knees by the bed. “I am
not strange! I am Hildegarde.”</p>

<p>His blazing eyes looked over her bowed head at the
little heap among the blackened stones. “Here!” he
whispered.</p>

<p>“What’s this?”</p>

<p>“A wind-match. Careful! there’s only one more.”</p>

<p>She rose unsteadily, with a sense of the utter uselessness
of any help now for this man who had been Jack
Galbraith. But as she struck the match, and the fire
caught among the sticks, once more the life leaped up in
the man. He sat erect, exultant, horrible to look upon,
tearing the leaves of a book, holding them up in sheaves,
and crying out: “Here, take the rest! I keep my word.
I give the Kingdom back to the oldest of the gods!”
And with that he fell together and lay with eyes hidden,
breathing hoarsely.</p>

<p>When she saw that the last pages, not even smoldering
any more, lay charred among the stones, she turned
again to the bedside. Was he dead? A long time she
stood there. What sound was that above the surf?
Again the long shrilling note. She went to the door.
Again! Of course; the steam whistle of the <i>Beluga</i>, calling
the travelers back. And this other traveler, had he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
heard a call? Was he, too, gone home? With trembling
knees she made her way back to the low bed. Again the
strident sound. It set the nerves a-shake. Painfully the
gaunt figure moved. It lifted up its face. It sent little-seeing
eyes to the stony altar. They seemed to search
among the ashes.</p>

<p>Again the wind bore over the water that harsh summons
to be gone. “Everything is burned,” said the
girl, and with a little strangled cry of “Bella! Bella!”
Hildegarde buried her face in her hands, sobbing: “Oh,
I think I was mad to help you. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad.”</p>

<p>She dropped her hands.</p>

<p>“Glad ... haven’t spoiled ... finest game in the
world ... the men who come after. Don’t know—what
they’ll do—when they’ve found it—but—hunting the
Pole—will last them ... good while yet. Ky—won’t
tell!”</p>

<p>Again the <i>Beluga’s</i> piercing call.</p>

<p>It carried Hildegarde to the door. Where was any
counsel? Where was Cheviot? Ah, yes! From the
heights behind the hut, he must have made the signal
agreed on before leaving the <i>Beluga</i>. Hildegarde could
see the small boat putting off now from the whaler.
What was she to do? If, after Cheviot’s promise, there
were delay, who could doubt the choleric captain would
not scruple to leave his undesired passengers behind. Or
if there were only threat of that—her father’s bewilderment
and misery. What to do! As she turned her eyes
away from the shining world without the door, her dazzled
vision found only shadows in the hut. She had
dreamed it all! No; that voice again: “—Still heels four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
degrees to starboard! One point? No; only a motion of
the floe in azimuth. I tell you we’re locked fast.”</p>

<p>“Please listen. I’m Bella’s friend. I—oh, come back
a moment.”</p>

<p>“Tell Borisoff—can’t hear with this infernal shrieking
of the boulders. By the Lord!”—he raised himself on
an elbow—“ten yards of this living, moving ice would
hold Goliath back. And it’s sixty miles to the sea!”</p>

<p>She turned her wet face to the door again. The tossing
boat out yonder seemed to go down before her eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t let any one in!”</p>

<p>“No, no.” There it was again, like a toy boat dancing
wildly before destruction.</p>

<p>“What I mind most,” the faint voice whispered, “is
not holding out till—I got across to Alaska. All those
months—all that sacrifice—all that suffering—and fail
in such a little thing!”</p>

<p>“Why,” interrupted the girl, “why did you want to
get to Alaska?”</p>

<p>“Why? I—I don’t seem to remember. There was a
reason. But it’s too far.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean—”</p>

<p>“I shall never get there now. Do you hear the music,
Ky?”</p>

<p>“The music?”</p>

<p>“Screaming of the ptarmigan. Music to us, wasn’t
it?” In a changed voice, rational, but weak: “I can’t
see you, Ky.”</p>

<p>“She’s here, with me, at the door.”</p>

<p>“Then she’s dim as she used to be when she plodded
on in front, wrapped in her cloud of frost-smoke.”</p>

<p>“Please try to listen. I—see the sailors bringing the
little boat through the surf.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s easy. Let ’em try the ice!”</p>

<p>“They’re coming for me.”</p>

<p>“You—you?”</p>

<p>“You don’t remember.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p>“I am—”</p>

<p>“Ky’s friend. Thank you.” Feebly he put out his
hand. But he would have drawn it back, if hers had not
closed trembling over it.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack! Jack!” she cried to herself, conscious of an
anguished impulse to hide the marred hands in her breast
to see if pity might not heal them!</p>

<p>“I think whatever comes of it,” she said brokenly, “I
mustn’t go.”</p>

<p>The glazed eyes looked at her in faint wonder.</p>

<p>“Because I am Hildegarde.”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t her name.”</p>

<p>“No, no. I am <em>Hildegarde Mar</em>.”</p>

<p>“A nice name.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve heard it before.”</p>

<p>“Hildegarde—?” The faintest motion of the wild
head making “No.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes.” She was on her knees by the bed. “My
father was your friend. My father is Nathaniel Mar.”</p>

<p>He said nothing for a moment. She thought he was
trying to coördinate the memories her words recalled.
But when he spoke it was to say, “No one must know but
Bella—only Bella in all the world.”</p>

<p>“Only Bella,” said the girl, and rose upright. But
through her tears she saw that his lips still moved.</p>

<p>“Will you—” he whispered. She bent down again to
catch the words. “Will you stand at the door—till the
boat is beached?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span></p>

<p>Hoping, with a catch at the heart, that old association
dimly stirred by the name Mar had brought him some
warmth of her presence in this chill hour, she tried to
find a voice to ask why he wanted her to wait those few
poor minutes at the door. But she had no need to put
the question. His eyes made answer, trying to follow
Ky, as the dog left the threshold and went with her
slow, halting gait, aimless, half across the little strip of
tundra to the sea.</p>

<p>“Don’t say—anything to me. And don’t”—the wild
face twitched with pain—“<em>don’t look at me</em>. Just—stand
there, with Ky—till the boat’s ready. And when
you go—don’t speak.” Again the dimming eyes sought
on the tundra for that vague shadow that was his fellow-explorer
and his friend. “I shall watch you, Ky—till
the whaler—takes you—South.”</p>

<p>As Hildegarde, bending lower, tried to form speech
with her quivering lips, “No,” he whispered. “You’ve
done—all—you—can. All, but this last thing. I’d like—to
see her as long as ever—But don’t speak, and—<em>don’t—look—back</em>.”</p>

<p>His eyes went past the girl, went straining after the
dog, as though Ky were in truth as dim to-day as on
that gray morning when he saw her first, standing in
front of the pack, wrapped in mist, nose to the north,
waiting for him “up yonder” by the Kara shore.</p>

<p>Out there, on the tundra edge again, the great explorer,
Ky, stood like some old coastguard reading the
signs of the sea.</p>

<p>Behind, at the door of the hut, Hildegarde Mar. But
though the girl, too, looked straight across the surf,
toward the islands named for those in the Adriatic after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
the Argive king, what she saw was not the nearer Diomede
and not the little boat fighting its way through the
surf; not even her lover running along the shore and
looking among the high-piled rocks; not John Galbraith,
dying behind her there in the shadow. Clearer than if
she’d held it in her hand, she saw the colored crayon
sketch that lay charred among the ashes. So it was like
that!—the terrible, beautiful place that would still go
luring men with its lying legend on all the maps, crying
out in every tongue in Europe—</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">At last! After fruitless, heart-sickening
search among the boulders, Cheviot had
caught sight of Hildegarde breasting easily
the risen wind, stepping lightly and without
the least inconvenience down from the
tundra to the beach. Over the rocks he came running,
making signals for haste. Red, too, a long way behind,
went racing along the shore, back and forth, barely out
of the spray; running seaward when the breakers retreated,
fleeing from them on their return, howling at
the sailors as they bent over their oars, hardly fifty
yards from the foam-line.</p>

<p>Hildegarde made her way blindly, stumbling among
stones, scattering bits of pilot bread in her wake, and
casting backward looks.</p>

<p>“Hurry! Hurry!” Cheviot was shouting.</p>

<p>“She’s so lame!” Hildegarde couldn’t hear his
next words, but she caught the quick gesture of one who
reproachfully reminds himself. And he was flying forward
to her aid.</p>

<p>“I’m all right—but the dog—”</p>

<p>Without slackening pace, a hand at either side of his
mouth, he called: “They can’t hold the boat in that
surf.”</p>

<p>“Ky—the dog—”</p>

<p>“Red’s all right. He’s there.” Louis was near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
enough now for her to see the heat of the race in his face
as he called out: “The captain will be furious—” The
rest was caught away by the wind, till quite near: “I’ll
pull you along. Here, catch hold of my hand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Louis, I’ve got something to tell—”</p>

<p>“—ankle giving out again?”</p>

<p>“No, not that.”</p>

<p>He turned sharply to signal the sailors that the lady
would be there in time.</p>

<p>“Louis!”</p>

<p>“Don’t waste breath! Come on!”</p>

<p>“Something’s happened. It’s about Jack Galbraith.”</p>

<p>Had he heard? What was he going to do? It hadn’t
occurred to her so much as to wonder before. Did he
think there was no hurry about this news she had picked
up concerning the long-lost traveler, or had the wind
carried the name away? Or—</p>

<p>“I must tell you about it, Louis. Wait a moment!”</p>

<p>“You’re asking the tide to wait!” And far from
gently his own momentum was carrying her on. Was
there then one service he would refuse her? I Well—well—she
steeled herself. He couldn’t refuse to take the
dog in any case.</p>

<p>“We—we can’t go so fast.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we can. We’ve got to.”</p>

<p>“No. I must wait for—the dog.”</p>

<p>A flying look of astonishment sent over shoulder shot
from her to Ky. “<em>That</em> dog?” But impatience drove
even wonderment out. “Can’t you see how close—” He
flung an arm toward the laboring boat, as with hot face
turned seaward to the wind he hurried on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span></p>

<p>“If the dog goes back he’ll think I failed him—”
The wind and the surf took the rest. In the turmoil of
her mind the first thing needful to assure seemed to be
Ky’s safe conveyance to the ship. While Louis, without
slackening speed, snatched her arm through his, compelling
her to keep his pace, still the girl looked back as
she held behind her the last of the lure. Ky was making
her way better than her new friend, for Hildegarde’s
weakened ankle turned more than once, and now she was
almost down. Cheviot had swung back and had her on
her feet again.</p>

<p>“Louis—” But the pain had turned her faint.</p>

<p>“It’s horrible to hurt you, but there mayn’t be
another boat this year,” he jerked out, starting on
again.</p>

<p>Hildegarde had no real fear of their being left.
Wasn’t “the watchman” with her? But Ky! The sailors
might refuse to wait for a dog.</p>

<p>“Here!” He shook off her slack hand and grasped
her by the arm. “I must help you more.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. Help me to get her down there in time.”</p>

<p>“All right!” But he was shouting the reassuring
words across the surf. “Come on!” he encouraged the
sailors. “Coming on” was easier said than done. An
instant the boat had fallen back.</p>

<p>“We’ll be there as soon as you!” Cheviot’s shout
dropped hoarsely: “We won’t if you can’t do better
than this.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to tell father—”</p>

<p>“If you stop to talk we’ll simply be left behind.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;" id="illus11">
<img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="450" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“Hildegarde’s ankle turned more than once, and now she was
almost down”</p>
</div>

<p>Ah, well, if he took it like that, why should she go any
further with him? “You’d better hurry on with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
dog,” she said. “Tell father he must manage somehow
to come.”</p>

<p>“Are you out of your head!” He seemed to be carrying
her forward without volition of hers. She offered
no physical resistance but, “I’m not coming with you to
the ship,” she said. “I’ve got to go back.”</p>

<p>“Go where, for God’s sake?”</p>

<p>“Back to the hut.”</p>

<p>“Go—what for?”</p>

<p>“Because Jack Galbraith is there.” For just an instant
his fingers slackened hold. The shadow of a fear
she had never seen in those clear eyes darkened the fine
candor of his face, and then, with firmer grasp, he was
once more hurrying her on.</p>

<p>“I’m not going crazy. It’s sober truth. Louis,
Louis, what are we to do?”</p>

<p>“Prevent that boat from leaving us behind.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you don’t care! It’s nothing to you!”</p>

<p>The hand on her arm tightened in such a grip she
could hardly keep from crying out with the pain of it, but
faster than ever the two were flying along the stony beach.</p>

<p>“Oh Louis, help me!” she said passionately, and holding
back by main force she brought down the pace.
“You wouldn’t want me to—oh, tell me what’s to be
done!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” Suddenly all that energy of his
seemed spent. “Perhaps nothing can be done.”</p>

<p>She had never before seen hopelessness in his face. It
pierced through all her preoccupation and excitement.
“Yes, yes, something can be done. You needn’t take it
as you’re doing. Oh, Louis, don’t you see, <em>you</em> might
go back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>I?</em>” He looked at her with eyes that made her draw
a breath of pain. “It is true,” he said; “I might go
back.”</p>

<p>“Will you?” she faltered.</p>

<p>“To Galbraith, you say! You <em>want</em> me to go back?”</p>

<p>“Do you ‘want’ to leave him here friendless, sick. Oh,
it was well I came! I must have had an inkling; yes,
yes, a presentiment.”</p>

<p>“<em>That’s</em> why you came! Why you waited here!”</p>

<p>The sailors might abandon their dangerous task and
leave those two there on the beach, for all it seemed to
matter to Louis Cheviot, since he had halted on the
words: “Galbraith behind these days, too!”</p>

<p>The shouting of the sailors made him turn his eyes.
The boat out there, baffled again, was driven back in a
third effort to make the final run. Cheviot with his free
hand shaped a trumpet, and through it shouted across
the surf, “Try up here!”</p>

<p>The men in the boat called out something that was
drowned in the clamor of the waves, and Cheviot was
running Hildegarde faster than ever down that last
stretch of the stony beach. Would he never stop and let
her get back her voice? Oh, this carrying a hot ball of
lead in your breast, and having to lift it every time you
strained for breath.</p>

<p>“Louis, wait! Ky, Ky, come on!” Why was he hurrying
her more than ever? Did he imagine— Her
power to think seemed to be leaving her. A wavering
vision off there in the sunshine of Louis’s late guide hurrying
down from the settlement with several other men,
two were natives. And the boat, where was the boat?
Beaten back again, and that time all but swamped. Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
now it was gone—down behind the white breakers, or
further down among the rocks? The look on Louis’s
face—it gave her a new measure of loneliness. It was
like the door of one’s own home locked and barred
against one. But she couldn’t see well, for the loosened
hair, blown into her eyes, was blinding her. Tears, too.
On and on over the water-worn stones with that harsh
hand grasping her. If her feet slipped they were not
suffered to falter, if they stumbled they were harshly
steadied. On and on with this constriction at the breast,
and at her side this face of granite. A moment’s memory
of the arctic current, and the picture that had stood
to Galbraith for the type of helpless human striving.
Something of the same sense of futility visited her as her
feet followed the stronger will. Did nothing matter then,
except this on and on? Death up yonder on the tundra.
Death down there in the surf. Pain wherever there was
life. Pain only to draw the breath. She got hers in
great, clutching gasps that stabbed her. Now they were
down near the foam-line. They were running in the wet
sand. The rage of the surf in her ears, the taste of the
brine on her lips. John Galbraith found, and John Galbraith
dying. Everything changing, Louis most of all.
The fabric of her world dissolving before her dazed eyes
to the sound of sea-born thunder.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to make a rush—and not mind a ducking!”
It was one of the sailors shouting. The big fellow
in the hip-boots had leaped out of the plunging boat
into the surf. He was hurled headlong, recovered footing,
and, streaming with sea water, buffeted his way out
of the foam, while he roared angrily, “Come on, if yer
comin’. Cap’n’s orders, bring ye or leave ye.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span></p>

<p>“The dog first,” Hildegarde cried out. “No, the lame
one.”</p>

<p>The sailor hesitated, swore, and then, on Cheviot’s
word, obeyed. His late guide panting, breathless, appeared
with the other men at his heels, all but the Esquimaux
with letters to send out. Cheviot thrust them in
his pocket.</p>

<p>“Now, Hildegarde.”</p>

<p>“Not both of us,” she said, meeting his eye.
“Which?” Each looked deep in that swift instant, neither
flinching.</p>

<p>“If you aren’t coming of your own accord—” he said.</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>He made a sign to the blaspheming sailor. The two
lifted her in their arms and carried her through the surf,
just as hours before they had carried her out.</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” said the sailor, “in with you.” Cheviot
stood with the foam swirling above his long boot tops.
“You want me to stay behind?” he called.</p>

<p>“If I could do it myself,” Hildegarde began.</p>

<p>Without a word he turned his back on her, strode out
of the water and up the stony beach.</p>

<p class="tb">If, upon his return home, Mr. Mar was surprised at the
warmth of his reception, he was yet more perplexed to
find himself never once called upon to state the value of
his Polaris mining interests.</p>

<p>When he sufficiently recovered from his astonishment
at this oversight on Mrs. Mar’s part, he tried once or
twice to introduce the subject of his claims into the family
circle. But his wife firmly changed the conversation,
as one who insists that painful bygones shall be bygones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
forever. Mar smiled inwardly, for Cheviot’s report had
been glowing, and for Cheviot to write like that—well, it
was, as the sage said, significant of much. But Cheviot
was still “in Alaska, looking after things,” and Mar
kept his own counsel.</p>

<p>It was plain that these last years had left their mark
upon his wife. He laid the change at first to the disintegrating
action of time upon even that hard, bright surface.
He never knew the secret rage he caused by attributing
to the weakness of age what was due to a hard-won
self-mastery, a realized and ripened affection. Only little
by little did he become aware that the alteration, so far
from being a sign of letting-go, was evidence of a fresh
taking-hold; a courageous determination not to shrink
from making unpleasant discoveries about herself merely
because she was of an age when most people cease to
make discoveries of any sort.</p>

<p>Whatever pains her late-won knowledge cost Mrs. Mar,
her family, and especially her old and broken husband,
reaped some benefit of that lady’s ability to go on learning
at a time of life when the majority think it rather noble
if they make so much as an effort to teach.</p>

<p>It is probable that, failing Hildegarde, Mar might
never have grasped the full meaning of the enlightenment
that had come to his life’s partner during these
three years of his absence. Upon that first glimpse of
him, as he came limping in at the door, his wife had
looked at him with a face no one who saw could forget.
“It’s been hard for you, too,” she said.</p>

<p>“For me, too?” he echoed, wondering.</p>

<p>But she had no other word, either then or after—no
gift of tender apology, nor even of explanation. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
task, as she conceived it, was not to talk about a long
past that was irrevocable, but to “show” the possibility
of a brief future that she felt to be still within their
reach.</p>

<p>For Hildegarde all life had come to a standstill.</p>

<p>Weeks must go by before Bella, at her old friend’s urgent
summons, could get back from abroad.</p>

<p>Hildegarde’s soreness of heart, her hopelessness of the
greater gladness for herself, left her the freer to think of
it as only half an achievement—this bringing her father
back in the flesh. She must see his spirit “at home” before
her task was ended. No discreet opportunity was
lost to set her mother in an explanatory light. When the
neighbors chorused admiration of the girl’s pluck and
resourcefulness on the great journey, oh-ing and ah-ing,
and “How on earth did you manage?”—“It was never
the least difficult,” Hildegarde would interrupt.
“When I was at a loss I always thought how my mother
would take hold of the matter, and when I had imagined
her into my perplexity it wasn’t a perplexity any longer.
I saw just what she would do, and I saw it was just
right.”</p>

<p>Only once, with her father alone, did she venture
openly to suggest a corrected judgment of the past.</p>

<p>They had been talking of Mrs. Locke. Mar, who had
failed so signally in getting a post for himself, had succeeded
in getting one for his daughter’s friend.</p>

<p>“You <em>have</em> been good about it!” Hildegarde said.
“I’m so grateful. So is she.”</p>

<p>“So is the firm. She’s a success.”</p>

<p>“It just shows!”</p>

<p>“Shows what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span></p>

<p>“That the reason women aren’t more use in the world
is because they don’t have a chance.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” said Mr. Mar.</p>

<p>“No. Not a real chance, father.”</p>

<p>“Good heaven! They have everything.”</p>

<p>“No. They don’t have education. I don’t mean out
of books. It’s just as Mrs. Locke says. They stand as
little chance of knowing about life as kings and queens
do. They are still a class apart.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she talks like that—your Mrs. Locke?” said Mar,
with an obvious uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Not of herself. Of the rest of us—unless”—she
smiled—“unless we’ve been to Nome; or, like mother,
to Mecca.”</p>

<p>“To Mecca?”</p>

<p>With a face more serious the girl went on: “I’ve only
just begun to notice who among the women I know are
the most successful and the most sensible. They’re the
ones that have had the most experience, gone about most,
or”—her voice sunk—“had some great trouble, <em>known</em>
about life somehow by knocking up against it. It looks
as if the only way to get judgment is by having to judge.
Men, of course—you’re always practising. You’re <em>in</em>
things. You aren’t an outsider.”</p>

<p>“Who is an outsider?”</p>

<p>“Every woman, when she comes out of her own front
door. Now”—before he could answer she hurried on—“now,
there’s mother” (she spoke as if she had only just
remembered her). “A clever person like mother—why, if
she’d had ten times as much to do, she’d have done it
ten times better. And she wouldn’t have had time to
think about—a—the cracks in the china. Yes, father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
you may depend upon it, it’s the women that haven’t
got much in them that fit best into the small places.
Mother’s always been crowded.”</p>

<p>When Bella came back from England that September,
Mar and his daughter had been already six weeks at
home. Although given full credit for having so happily
reconstituted the domestic circle, for Hildegarde herself
the devouring loneliness that had invaded existence
showed its first sign of yielding when Bella’s childish
face appeared at the door. None the less for Bella’s
friend a shrinking of the heart as she held close the
slight figure in its smart French gown. What a butterfly
to be broken on the wheel of life!</p>

<p>“But Louis!” Twenty minutes after her arrival,
Bella, as she followed Hildegarde up-stairs, put the question
for the second time. Why had he stayed behind?</p>

<p>Hildegarde’s only answer was to hold open the door of
her room and, when the new-comer had passed through,
to shut it softly behind them both. Still in silence she
laid down Bella’s hat and gloves, and then came and
stood beside her friend, who sat watching her from the
old nook of the cushioned window-seat.</p>

<p>“You might have told me something, even in a cable.
What happened up there?” Bella said softly.</p>

<p>“What happened?”</p>

<p>“Yes. About Louis.”</p>

<p>“I came to realize him. There’s nothing like that
wonderful north light for making you see truly.”</p>

<p>“Well, what did you find he was like when you saw
him—like that, in a north light?”</p>

<p>“I found that he was—the man I wanted to go
through life with.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve been hoping for that,” said Bella quietly.</p>

<p>“Ah, but I didn’t only find him up there. I lost him,
too.”</p>

<p>Bella leaned forward and took Hildegarde’s hand.
Very gently she drew her down on the cushioned seat.</p>

<p>Hildegarde had turned her filling eyes away, but she
faced her friend for the moments of that low crying,
“Oh, Bella, Bella, when you think what a miracle it is to
find the right one in the maze, how is it that we ever let
the right one go?”</p>

<p>Bella released the hand she had taken and turned her
head, looking out of the window.</p>

<p>But Hildegarde’s thrilling voice went on: “I wonder
we don’t watch at the gate of the Beloved from dawn till
night, waiting till he comes. I wonder he doesn’t lie all
night at her door, for fear in a dream she may steal
away.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said the other, “in broad daylight each
lets the other go.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and with an air of being willing. Of being able
to bear their going. And we can’t bear it!” Her
dimmed eyes fell on Bella’s beautiful face. “At least, I
can’t bear it—or—if I do, it will be because you help me,
Butterfly Bella. For you’ve learned how.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve learned how.”</p>

<p>Strange, wonderful little Bella. Hildegarde stared at
the slight creature, half-stoic and half-sprite.</p>

<p>“How was it? Why couldn’t Louis see?”</p>

<p>“I tried his patience again and again.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t wait till you got him in a north light for
that.”</p>

<p>“—and he was strong and kind and immovable in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
goodness, no matter what I did or said. And his faithfulness
to my father—there aren’t any words for that.
But you remember—Bella, sit close—mother told you
about the hermit.”</p>

<p>“The hermit?”</p>

<p>“The strange man they all thought had found the
Mother Lode.”</p>

<p>Step by step, moment by moment, she went through
those hours at Polaris, though there was little need to
take Bella farther than the threshold of the hut.</p>

<p>She held up two shaking hands, and, “I know! I
know!” she whispered. “Before you open the door, before
you knock—I know.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Bella, with an intensity of quietness.
And like that to the end—looking more than ever a
spirit, and like a spirit seeming to have no human heart
for breaking, Bella listened with wide, far-looking eyes
that half the time were tearless.</p>

<p>It was Hildegarde who broke down when she told how
at the last, Ky and she had left him. When her choked
voice failed: “Of course, I know the end,” said Bella,
and they held each other fast, sitting there a long time
with no word spoken.</p>

<p>At last Hildegarde felt the small hands loose their
hold. Bella stood up. And now she was walking up and
down the room. At last, as by a chance, her eyes found
Hildegarde, and a great gentleness came into the little
face. She came back to the window and stood close
against her friend.</p>

<p>Hildegarde lifted her head. “You say you know the
end, but you don’t quite. Louis came calling me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
hurry,” and she told of those few minutes on the beach.
“I didn’t realize I was ruining my life. I went on insisting.
Yes, Jack Galbraith didn’t die deserted, for I
sent him in his last hour my best chance of happiness.
I clung to the side of the boat and watched Louis cross
the beach with Reddy at his heels. Ky was crouching at
the stern with her black muzzle turned to the shore,
howling, howling. The men were angry, the dog was in
their way. “She is hungry,” I said. She had begun to
gnaw the glove I had dropped in the bottom of the boat.
Then it suddenly flashed over me! If there was nothing
in the hut to feed a hungry dog, neither was there any
food for a man.”</p>

<p>Bella hid her face.</p>

<p>With fresh tears Hildegarde went on, “And Louis
wouldn’t know. It hadn’t occurred to me at all while I
was there. I found myself sobbing, and saying half out
loud, ‘Oh, God, oh, God, is <em>that</em> why Jack is dying?’ The
sailors were staring. I leaned over and said to the big
Dane, ‘Do you want to make some money, you and these
others? I’ll pay you, pay you well, if you’ll give me
just five minutes more on shore.’ No, no. They were
all of one mind. ‘I’ll pay you ten dollars a minute,’ I
said, and I’d have gone on offering more if they hadn’t
turned back for that. It’s risking life, they said, and
they told me how the captain—But they thought I was
distracted at leaving Louis, and that all I wanted was to
get him. They liked Louis. They turned back. Just
then the whistle screamed out from the <i>Beluga</i> very angrily.
But they ran the boat in on a great wave, and I
flung out through the surf and ran up on the tundra
calling Louis. He was standing at the door of the hut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
with the man who’d shown him the way to the mines.
Louis turned round when he heard my voice, and oh,
Bella, the look on his face! ‘So you couldn’t leave it to
me <em>even to bury him</em>,’ he said.” She hid her eyes in
Bella’s lap. “And that was the end.”</p>

<p>There was a long, long silence. At last a hand on
Hildegarde’s hair, and Bella’s voice saying: “For <em>you</em> it
wasn’t the end.”</p>

<p>The other lifted her face. “Yes, for me, too.
‘There’s nothing to be done,’ Louis repeated that. I
was to go back, he said, for my father’s sake. And I did.
I was quite dazed. But for me, too, it was the end.”</p>

<p>“Where is Louis now?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I haven’t seen him since.”</p>

<p>“Nor heard?”</p>

<p>“I got a letter to him, but—”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t there time for an answer?”</p>

<p>“I got an answer. But there was nothing in the letter.”</p>

<p>“Nothing?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, but how they’d buried John Galbraith.
Oh, <em>Bella</em>!” Hildegarde’s horror-struck eyes besought
forgiveness.</p>

<p>But Bella spoke with a strange steadiness. “Louis
didn’t say any of the things you wanted him to say?”</p>

<p>Hildegarde shook her head. “We waited, father and
I. We lived on board first one and then another steamer.
And two ships went away without us. Father was so
good, so good. He moved heaven and earth to get another
message to Polaris to say that we were waiting.
And Louis never came. I have hurt him so much he
can’t bear even to see me.” They sat in the silence, crying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bella.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You and I will never let each other go.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Bella.</p>

<p>“You and I alone together till the end.”</p>

<p>“And Ky.”</p>

<p>“Ky, of course,” Hildegarde amended. “Where is
she now?”</p>

<p>“Down there, in the shade of the redwood. There,
don’t you see?”</p>

<p>Hildegarde shook her head. “Not very well.” She
wiped away her tears. “But that’s how I kept seeing
life all the way home. You and the great discoverer
and I.”</p>

<p>Bella had stood up. “You’re as blind as Ky!”</p>

<p>“Why do you say that?” Hildegarde asked miserably,
with a sudden sense of desertion. “What do <em>you</em> see,
then?”</p>

<p>“Louis Cheviot coming across the lawn.”</p>
